# 14 Big ideas of Buddhism

1. All phenomena in life are conditioned. One phenomena is unconditioned-nibbana.

2. Dependent origination. Phenomena are dependent on one another.  We are in the cycle of birth death. Breaking ignorance breaks us out of the dependent origination.

3. There is conventional truth and absolute truth. There are conventional realities and absolute realities. There are ideas and realities. 

4. The purpose of Buddhism is the realisation of absolute truth by developing understanding of absolute realities. This is meditation. The eightfold path is the means through which this happens. The understanding which understands these conditioned realities is also conditioned.

5. All absolute realities have three characteristics, anatta, dulkkha, annica. The eightfold path leads to understanding these three characteristics. 

6. When these three characteristics are understood, the unconditioned reality nibbana can be understand. Highly developed understanding of reality can experience nibbana.

7. By experiencing nibbana our faults are forever eliminated. We will not continue in the cycle of birth and death. The end of the cycle of birth and death is paranibbana.

8. Life is fair. Kamma conditions the experience of phenomena according to previous deeds. The phenomena themselves are not necessarily produced by kamma. Ie a stomachache can be caused by bad food but the experience of it is caused by kamma. Our rebirth is conditioned by kamma. 

9. We are infatuated with the objects through 6 doorways. Sights, sounds, touches, tastes, smells, mind. It is like a tangled spiders web. 

10. Birth is suffering, because it lasts only a moment. Happiness is suffering because it does not stay. True happiness is freedom from enslavement to the objects we experience. Contentment is the greatest wealth.

11. LIfe is very short, very fragile. It is a matter of urgency to develop the path.

12. Our many faults, greed, jealousy, anger, hinder the development of understanding. These faults are like having an illness when travelling to a destination.

13. Buddhism does not depend on faith, but on the development of understanding of the present reality. The highest form of 'worship' is the development of the path.

14. The teachings of the Buddha are encompassed by the four noble truths. Suffering, its cause, it's cessation and the way leading to its cessation.
