- The understanding that begins to know conditioned realities is also
conditioned.

- Right understanding understands not a person or a Buddhist.

arising. If there is no arising, there is no dukkha. If there is no

moments. Once there is no arising there can be total peace and
calm.

the value and develop it.

for the arising of awareness, because awareness can arise anytime
or place. Don't limit it.

now?

no matter what one is doing.

any level, because to have kusala citta at any moment is so
helpful.

attachment, it hinders the progress of right understanding.

awareness, but we nee some awareness for this.

- While day dreaming, we are lost in concepts and thinking, lost in
the sense doors, thinking of concepts of past rupas through the
sense doors.

them to be attached to us.

more understanding developed.

attached to one's feeling, not really the person...

- Attachment is only a conditioned moment. Attachment is like a trap
or a bait.

ignorance. We are trapped, lured by attachment all the time. It's

no developing or seeing realities as they are.

- It is very confusing if there is no understanding of the
development of vipassana.

- It is very natural in daily life, the teachings of the Buddha.

- One cannot get away from thinking of people, so in many suttas the
Buddha taught many people to develop the four Brahma viharas.

- At the moment of considering someone's death, there can be the
condition for calmness instead of trying to force calmness by
thinking of different objects.

- Does visual object appear as just visual object now? It cannot
appear as visual object o moha.

- By developing vipassana one can see different levels of thinking,
because there can be thinking before thinking in words or concepts.

- Now if one is asked 'what are you thinking', can you tell? At that
moment it can be moha
-mula
-citta which thinks.

- An arahat also thinks about concepts after seeing, but maha
-kiriya
citta thinks about concept without akusala.

lobha
-mmula
-citta which thinks?

kusala and no calmness at the moment of akusala.

when there is no understanding.

- If there is respect at this moment it is kusala.

development of understanding.

- The Buddha's teaching is for practice, not just for reading or
intellectual understanding.

- Right understanding knows everything correctly.

- Right understanding gradually eliminates attachment and ignorance
and wrong view of self.

- At this moment of understanding reality, it is not self that
understands.

- Never enough understanding, because each moment is conditioned.

- One has to understand what is the right object of awareness first.

- When there is the idea of self with wrong view, it conditions other
akusala. One is attached to oneself so much that one does not
realise that whatever one is attached to, one is attached to self.

- One thinks one is so attached to a person, but really one is
attached to one's feeling, so one clings to one's defilements.

- No matter how much one thinks, one cannot eradicate the idea of
self.

- Hearing this moment is not hearing a moment ago.

- 3 kinds of death:

	- Conventional death

	- Momentary death

	- Final death for an arahat

- Without precise understanding of paramattha and sammuti sacca there
cannot be the eradication of self.

- Daily life is paramattha.

- By developing understanding of realities in one's life as they are,
one sees one still has lots of akusala.

- Only right understanding can eliminate wrong understanding,
gradually, at the moment right understanding arises.

- Intellectual understanding covers up the truth because there is no
awareness at that moment of a characteristic as it appears.

- Intellectual understanding should be the foundation, but if one
thinks that it is enough, there is no development and it hinders
the development of higher understanding because one does not
understand there are more levels of higher understanding.

- It's possible to have all the intellectual understanding but no
understanding of the practice, like a blind man carrying a torch.

- One does not see the value of the eradication of self because one
clings to oneself all the time. When there is less the idea of
self, one develops more pure kusala.

- When there is less clinging to self, the weak points are detected.

- Craftiness lures to different objects...

- When the monk abandons home life, there are more conditions for
being virtuous at the degree of being able to leave home.

- Dukkha in the absolute sense is the arising and falling away of
each moment because it cannot stay.

kusala.

rather than a teacher.

- One is attached to oneself, to one's feeling when one cares what
the other thinks.

- What is right is right.

- Akusala is so ugly.

- We all want to be the object of attachment. We think of self and
world collapses with the idea of being a nobody. There is no seeing
the value of no attachment, the real freedom when there is no
enslavement.

- Lack of confidence is what sati can and cannot do is not helpful.

- Wrong view guides one's tanha tanha for one's wrong ideas.

- Getting to know oneself better is the only way to really help
others. If one develops more metta, karuna, more understanding and
a more sincere inclination to other people, one will see that what
has been most helpful to oneself will be what is most helpful to
others also. One understands oneself better.

- Sound is obviously what it is when one's understanding grows. One
does not have to call it by any name.

- It is because sound appears that we can think about it in different
ways.

- Cannot whatever happens in daily life be a subject for teaching
dhamma?

- Whatever we receive in this life has its cause in some good deed in
this life or in a previous life.

- Finally if comes down to a cause here which is what makes it
possible to understand life and do something about it.

- If metta is strong enough one will be concerned to help.

- If sati does not arise understanding cannot know which are the
moments of sati and which are the moments without sati.

- The purpose should be right understanding.

- Be an island... depend on oneself, one's own understanding which
can eradicate one's defilements.

- Attached to rubbish...

- Want to have conditions for the arising of satipatthana, waiting
for the arising of satipatthana this is not the understanding of
the development of sati. The moment of thinking it is not the
moment of direct awareness.

- Intellectual understanding is useful, but don't think that one has
to think and think and think so that satipatthana will arise.

- To know the difference between thinking and sati, there has to be
sati.

- Panna which performs the function of detachment is the highest
meaning of upekkha.

- Sati is not forgetful to be kusala, not forgetful to think about
the object in the right way. If you forget, can there be studying?

- Metta is seeing the loveableness of all beings.

- The intention to do harm brings harm the place where harm
originated.

- Whenever there are results, we know that those resulted in their
cause.

- We have the idea that we can run away from vipaka.

- We never know when vipaka will come.

- We have an idea of cause and result but it's wrong.

- There must be right understanding, precisely, of this moment.

- One can think of one's kusala with lobha.

- When there are conditions for sati, sati will arise.

- Attachment likes calmness so much that it clings immediately.

- If one is not courageous enough, one clings to calmness for sure.

- At this moment of thinking one begins to see whether one thinks
with kusala or akusala.

- One wakes up for one short moment of sati and then the dream takes
over.

- The sound that is heard now does not hear anything.

- One cannot afford to be disinterested in reality.

- At the moment of seeing visible object as visible object, there is
no attractiveness in visible object.

- The way to know the present moment is to begin to know this moment
now.

- Learn to give without strings attached.

- We have bad opinions of others, but do we like others to have bad
opinions of us?

- With developed right understanding, one knows everything one knew
before, but one knows something one didn't know before.

- One will understand more about hearing and thinking in addition to
hearing and thinking.

- It's very easy to have misunderstanding about what one thinks to be
oneself.

- When one gossips, one doesn't think about the other or the person
one is gossiping to. Would one like to think he is gossiping about
us?

- The words may be all right, but still there is no right
understanding.

- The citta which solves the problem arises and falls away. The
solution to life is not to be born.

- We cannot develop panna if we don't see the value of dana and sila.

- If one treats all as though they are one's child with metta, this
way one cannot have any attachment.

- Even though lay people lead busy lives, they can get to know their
busy lives better.

- The taking away of anything from anyone is not wholesome.

- Even if you look through a microscope you still only see visible
object.

- If one always wants to be right, how will one deal with situations
where one is wrong.

- One's understanding has to learn to know the obvious, not to
overlook what is staring one in the face.

- We overlook the obvious all the time, especially nama, the
experience which makes it possible to experience colour right now.

- Colour arises but doesn't appear if there is no seeing.

must be awareness.

happiness.

- Dosa can't help.

- People are never impressed when the right thing is said in the
wrong way.

- Waiting doesn't bring kusala of any kind.

- On and on and on we have this idea of self and we don't know it.

- The more one studies satipatthana, the more honest one becomes.

- When sati is developed one becomes more resigned to the truth.

- Know oneself first and one will know the other man better.

- Satipatthana is indispensable.

- When one studies more, one sees one's abysmal ignorance.

- It takes time and patience to develop sati.

- We have to know what is not known to know what ignorance is.

- One can't help the other to understand without words, but the words
are not the understanding. The realities of our life are not words.

- Begin again to know this moment which has not been know yet.

- The arahat has given up the struggle by understanding realities.

- We always take refuge in that which is not safe or secure. The
ultimate refuge is nibbana.

- Having forgotten, he remembers, he begins again.

- We continue to be beginners that having forgotten, we will
remember.

- More ignorance, more wrong understanding, more attachment and this
will mean more unhappiness, so matter how difficult we find it what
choice do we have. We either go forward or we go with the rest of
the world backwards and down. Even if we go forwards only a little
bit it's much better than going backwards. If we understand how
important it is to go forward, if we see the value of progress and
the dangers of falling backwards then perhaps there will be more
conditions for us to study, to listen, to develop kusula and to see
progress taking place.

- From the beginning it must be Right Understanding. But the only
moment that we can progress, the one and only moment in our whole
life ...is this moment.

- If our understanding is very, very weak, then the little bit of
understanding we may gain now will not be enough for us to see the
truth. But without accumulating one little bit now, the moment will
never come when wisdom is strong enough to know the truth.

- We know from our own lives that we don't always give help when help
is needed.

- Loving kindness has to be a reality for us in our actions and
speech from day to day as we live.

- Loving kindness isn't just a word. It's a reality which has to be
known through practice in our daily life.

- Everybody loses when we don't have metta.

- We have to be kind instead of wishing everyone else was kind.

- Thinking that everyone else should be kind or wondering why they
are not kind.

- The only way we will ever be able to prove the Buddha's teachings
is by beginning to practice them and see what happens. There's no
other way.

- There is never a moment goes by when awareness cannot arise.

- It is loving kindness that helps us present Dhamma is a gentle way
without being pushy... And that's hard.

- We don't have kindness when we expect too much of someone. They
should understand, why? Because we say so, because we teach so
well, because it's the truth. People should be kind. Why? Because
we think so, because it would be nice. It depends on conditions.

- If we don't develop Sati, we can't keep the precepts. So what could
be kinder?

- It's kindness when we develop Satipatthana, we are being kind to
ourselves and kind to everybody else. We're doing the whole world a
favour. We're removing a little bit of ignorance from the world
that makes us behave and act the way we do.

- The way to develop more understanding is exactly the same for every
living being that was ever born. To be aware of the reality which
appears now in your life whatever that reality may be.

- There can be no short cut.

- The practice of Satipatthana is the most subtle thing.

- All moments are moments for awareness.

- What is kusula without Right Understanding, it's just self, self,
self.

- A moment of Satipattana that is aware of akusula is so much more
valuable than kusula without Sati.

- Who can stop realities from arising?

- At moments of desire for awareness, at moments of trying to be
aware of a particular object, to try and force, to try and be aware
here, here, here, it's all wrong, its not natural.

- We cannot call back any reality.

- Results for whom.

- It's good to know the truth that all realities of our life our
Dukkha. They arise and fall away.

- If we think that the way to be happy is to get what you want and to
have nice things to like at, to hear, taste and smell. We'll make
lobha our God and devote our lives to serving lobha... and that's
the path to pain.

- There is really nothing better in life to do, than to find out what
life is all about.

- We find out in practice what we are told in theory.

- Who can say what will happen next.

- It is conditioned, it is unavoidable, uncontrollable.

- Dosa is Dosa, it's not Dosa with a body it's not Dosa that can do
anything.

- How can you blame Dosa?

- We can't not have akusala.

- We have the illusion of control all our life except at the moment
of sati. It helps to eradicate that illusion.

- The condition for the development of Sati is Right Understanding of
it.

- We can't really develop right understanding, if we are not ashamed
of our ignorance of realities, if we are not afraid of not knowing
the truth about realities.

- True respect for Dhamma is not just listening and understanding
what you hear but putting into practice what you hear.

- Only a coward performs akusula because he's afraid of
inconvenience, afraid of trouble, afraid of poverty therefore he's
capable of and shamelessly performs akusala.

in England.


- One cannot live without pleasure and one cannot live without
dhammma. Wise people cannot live just for pleasure. The wise one
will live with pleasure and with understanding.

- The development of awareness is the highest degree of kusala.

- As the moment of aversion find out whether it's just a name or a
reality which is the object of aversion.

- The outside is very clean the body is washed, but how many times
are citta and cetasika washed with understanding.

- The fire on one's head is this moment.

- No matter we are happy or sad. Dhamma should be the important thing
in life.

- Life cannot be smooth without Right Understanding.

- If people think that Dhamma will destroy their happiness, they
don't understand Dhamma.

- We cannot rate the prize of the 'Best Friend'.

- Lobha encourages wrong view and wrong view encourages lobha. They
are friends.

- When one enjoys something very much nobody can help, because there
are conditions for that degree of enjoyment, but Right
Understanding can understand and awareness can be aware. And that
moment of awareness is the eightfold path. So one should understand
all conditioned realities that happen one's life.

- Seeing is conditioned, pleasant feeling is conditioned. It has its
own conditions already. We shouldn't prepare any other conditions
for any reality to arise.

- Understanding can follow all six doorways until there is no doubt
about conditioned realities.

- Nobody can condition any reality.

- The present moment is the most important moment.

- The disadvantage of seeing is that attachment follows it. The
advantage of seeing is that understanding follows it.

- As long as there is expectation Vipassana nana cannot arise.

- One has to be so very patient to understand the teachings.

- There is always danger when there is experiencing of an object with
ignorance. It's like stepping on a thorn. If there is no
development of sati, we enjoy stepping on thorn.

- The teachings are the Dhamma mirror, they help to see inside
clearly.

- Look carefully and step on the place where there is no thorn.

- It's not enough just to learn from the book. Right Understanding
and awareness should be able to understand this moment as no self,
no being at all.

- Discussion is the most important factor for the development of
Right Understanding.

- The more one wants to have panna, the more one sees that it's only
wishing or wanting, it's not the right cause for the arising of
panna. The right cause for the arising of panna must be learning,
studying, considering. There can be awareness at anytime by
sankhara khanda conditioning it, not by one's wish.
