      ><li
      ><p
	>The arising of any conditioned reality is dukkha because of its arising. If there is no arising, there is no dukkha. If there is no awareness of the reality now, how can one understand the absolute reality of dukkha?</p
	></li

	></li
      ><li
      ><p

	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>If right understanding is well established, what about awareness now?</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p

      ><li
      ><p

      ><li
      ><p

      ><li
      ><p
	>We have to learn when there is awareness and when there is no awareness, but we nee some awareness for this.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>While day dreaming, we are lost in concepts and thinking, lost in the sense doors, thinking of concepts of past rupas through the sense doors.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>We must be brave enough to study with panna any reality. We need to be brave to begin to study visible object as visible object.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>One doorway is never enough. Each doorway should be a check.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>It is kindness to others if we don't cling to them or encourage them to be attached to us.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>The test is at this moment. Test now...Visual object now is the test of whether one has understanding or whether there should be more understanding developed.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>With understanding and awareness of calmness, calmness grows.</p
	></li
      ><li

	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>One is burnt by one's desire all the time. In reality one is attached to one's feeling, not really the person...</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Attachment is only a conditioned moment. Attachment is like a trap or a bait.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>One kills oneself and one's heart by one's attachment and ignorance. We are trapped, lured by attachment all the time. It's truly poisonous.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>We are cut up with sammuti sacca when there is no awareness of thinking.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>There are different conditions for different namas and rupas. With more understanding of different conditions you will see that there is no self.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>It needs right understanding to know whether this moment is kusala or akusala.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>In a day we can see that there are more moments of akusala than kusala.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>It is not in the texts, but is now at the moment of right understanding.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>When one thinks 'I am aware', it is not right awareness.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>When it is not right awareness, it cannot be accompanied by right understanding.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Whenever right awareness arises, it is aware before there is time to think 'I am aware'.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>When one says it is hearing, does one know anything about hearing?</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>It is a reality sometimes very hard to be experienced.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>When there is no awareness, right understanding cannot grow.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>When there is no awareness, no understanding, no learning, there is no developing or seeing realities as they are.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>It is very confusing if there is no understanding of the development of vipassana.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>It is very natural in daily life, the teachings of the Buddha.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>One cannot get away from thinking of people, so in many suttas the Buddha taught many people to develop the four Brahma viharas.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>At the moment of considering someone's death, there can be the condition for calmness instead of trying to force calmness by thinking of different objects.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Does visual object appear as just visual object now? It cannot appear as visual object o moha.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>By developing vipassana one can see different levels of thinking, because there can be thinking before thinking in words or concepts.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Now if one is asked 'what are you thinking', can you tell? At that moment it can be moha -mula -citta which thinks.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>An arahat also thinks about concepts after seeing, but maha -kiriya citta thinks about concept without akusala.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>If there is thinking of 'samma Buddha' who can know whether it is lobha -mmula -citta which thinks?</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>One begins to see the difference between calmness at the moment of kusala and no calmness at the moment of akusala.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>When right understanding grows, awareness also grows.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Right understanding is not in the text, it is at the moment of understanding what seeing is.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Whatever arises must be some type of reality, kusala or akusala.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Nibbana does not arise.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Citta goes all the time form moment to moment. It comes and goes all the time in the way of kulala or akusala. Nibbana does not come and go.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>The growth of vipaassana must begin with detachment and go the way of detachment, because attachment is very subtle and always wins when there is no understanding.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>If there is respect at this moment it is kusala.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>One knows oneself while the others cannot know.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>The purpose of the Satipatthana Sutta is to show that any object which is real can be the object of awareness. Otherwise this moment which is real cannot be known.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Learn to see dhamma as dhamma.</p
	></li
      ><li

	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Right understanding knows everything correctly.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Right understanding gradually eliminates attachment and ignorance and wrong view of self.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>At this moment of understanding reality, it is not self that understands.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Never enough understanding, because each moment is conditioned.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>One has to understand what is the right object of awareness first.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>When there is the idea of self with wrong view, it conditions other akusala. One is attached to oneself so much that one does not realise that whatever one is attached to, one is attached to self.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>One thinks one is so attached to a person, but really one is attached to one's feeling, so one clings to one's defilements.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>No matter how much one thinks, one cannot eradicate the idea of self.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Hearing this moment is not hearing a moment ago.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>3 kinds of death:</p
	><ul
	><li
	  ><p
	    >Conventional death</p
	    ></li
	  ><li
	  ><p
	    >Momentary death</p
	    ></li
	  ><li
	  ><p
	    >Final death for an arahat</p
	    ></li
	  ></ul
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Without precise understanding of paramattha and sammuti sacca there cannot be the eradication of self.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Daily life is paramattha.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>By developing understanding of realities in one's life as they are, one sees one still has lots of akusala.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Only right understanding can eliminate wrong understanding, gradually, at the moment right understanding arises.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Intellectual understanding covers up the truth because there is no awareness at that moment of a characteristic as it appears.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Intellectual understanding should be the foundation, but if one thinks that it is enough, there is no development and it hinders the development of higher understanding because one does not understand there are more levels of higher understanding.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>It's possible to have all the intellectual understanding but no understanding of the practice, like a blind man carrying a torch.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>One does not see the value of the eradication of self because one clings to oneself all the time. When there is less the idea of self, one develops more pure kusala.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>When there is less clinging to self, the weak points are detected.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Craftiness lures to different objects...</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>When the monk abandons home life, there are more conditions for being virtuous at the degree of being able to leave home.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Dukkha in the absolute sense is the arising and falling away of each moment because it cannot stay.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Whatever is real can be proved.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>In the beginning sati is slow and awkward.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Seeing the lack of any alternative is a way of seeing the value of kusala.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>If the blind man thinks he can see, he's really in trouble.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Any intellectual understanding cannot be clear.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Do we hope for result for me?</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>One begins with detachment from the very beginning.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Better to be a nobody than a somebody. Better to be a good friend rather than a teacher.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>One is attached to oneself, to one's feeling when one cares what the other thinks.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>What is right is right.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Akusala is so ugly.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>We all want to be the object of attachment. We think of self and world collapses with the idea of being a nobody. There is no seeing the value of no attachment, the real freedom when there is no enslavement.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Lack of confidence is what sati can and cannot do is not helpful.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Wrong view guides one's tanha tanha for one's wrong ideas.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Getting to know oneself better is the only way to really help others. If one develops more metta, karuna, more understanding and a more sincere inclination to other people, one will see that what has been most helpful to oneself will be what is most helpful to others also. One understands oneself better.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Sound is obviously what it is when one's understanding grows. One does not have to call it by any name.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>It is because sound appears that we can think about it in different ways.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Cannot whatever happens in daily life be a subject for teaching dhamma?</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Whatever we receive in this life has its cause in some good deed in this life or in a previous life.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Finally if comes down to a cause here which is what makes it possible to understand life and do something about it.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>If metta is strong enough one will be concerned to help.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>If sati does not arise understanding cannot know which are the moments of sati and which are the moments without sati.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>The purpose should be right understanding.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Be an island... depend on oneself, one's own understanding which can eradicate one's defilements.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Attached to rubbish...</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Want to have conditions for the arising of satipatthana, waiting for the arising of satipatthana this is not the understanding of the development of sati. The moment of thinking it is not the moment of direct awareness.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Intellectual understanding is useful, but don't think that one has to think and think and think so that satipatthana will arise.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>To know the difference between thinking and sati, there has to be sati.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Panna which performs the function of detachment is the highest meaning of upekkha.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Sati is not forgetful to be kusala, not forgetful to think about the object in the right way. If you forget, can there be studying?</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>Metta is seeing the loveableness of all beings.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>The intention to do harm brings harm the place where harm originated.</p

      ><li
      ><p
	>Whenever there are results, we know that those resulted in their cause.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>We have the idea that we can run away from vipaka.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>We never know when vipaka will come.</p
	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>We have an idea of cause and result but it's wrong.</p

	></li
      ><li
      ><p
	>One can think of one's kusala with lobha.</p

We either go forward or we go with the rest of the world backwards and down. Even if we go forwards only a little bit it's much better than going backwards. If we understand how important it is to go forward, if we see the value of progress and the dangers of falling backwards then perhaps there will be more conditions for us to study, to listen, to develop kusula and to see progress taking place.</p
