Death

Dharmnapada, v.128 In. the Visuddhimagga reference is made tb death (Iriarana) as ‘the ‘interruption of the life faculty included within(the limits of) a single becoming (existence). ; Death 'deéth as‘términatio11 (c.u£ting off), in other words,

the A1:ahant'&~ termination‘ of ihe suffering of the round. . .. Thirdly, death
can refer momentary death; in other words, the momentary dissolution of formations. .. .'

The Buddha taught many reminders to show how the first kind of death iis the natural course for the living being. In the Salla Sutta (The Arrow, Sutta NipE.te., vw. 5711-593) we read:

‘Just as the pots made by a potter all end by being broken, so death is (the breaking up) of Life... Of those overcome by death and. passing to another world, a father cannot hold back his son, nor relatives a relation, See? While the relatives are looking on and weeping, (me by one each mortal is led away like an ox to the slaughter. In this manner the world is afflicted by death and decay. But the wise do not grieve having realized the nature of the world... If any benefit is gained hy lamenting the wise would cl-0 av feel. we-uld harm himself, Yet through weeping and sorrowing the mind does not calm, but still more suffering. is produced’ the body is harmed and 0-no becomes lean. and pale, - one merely hurts oneself. . . . He who seeks happiness should withdraw the arrow: his own lamentations, longings and grief. With arrow withdrawn, unattached, he would attain to peace of mind .; and when all; sorrow has been transcended he is» sorrow-free and has realised Nibbana.



1 ath.txt" In the Visuddhimagga (Cu \/111, i';),we are told that 0ne'should 1-wk here and there at beings that have been killed or have cieéi, and advert to the death 92f bgings already fiezd but formerly seen tizings, cl-Jim-_: s; with with a sense Qf urgency an’? vi ah knr.-vrleége, after which 12: exeitpise his attention in the way be-ginning ‘Death will take p1ace'. By so doiﬁg he exercises it wise1y....' It also suggests that the recollecting should be diine thus , ‘Just as a murderer appears with 2. sword, thinking 1 shall cut this man's: head off‘ , and applies it to. his neck, so death appéars Why? Beg,-.. ause it comes with birth and it ‘bakes away life.‘ A little further on it is emphasised in the Visudziniuagga (Ch VEII, 1%) that:



‘Furthermore, all health ends in sickness, all youth ends; in ageing, all life ends in death; all worldly existence is procured by birth, haunted by ageing, surprised. by sickness, and struck down by death, Hence it is said: As though huge mountains maﬁa of rock So. v.-ast they reached up to the sky Were to advance from every side , - Grinding them all that lives, - So age and death roll over all , t Warriors, priests, merchants , and craftsmen, The outcastes and tile scavengers, Crushing all beings, sparing none. Ami here no tr-seps of elephants,

No riches, serwe to beat them off‘.

This is how death should be recollected as the ‘ruin of success‘ by defining it as death's final ruining nf life's success. '

Khun pointed out that one has less attachment to what ans clings to when one often thinks of death. One ‘when cne thinks 01’ death correctly it can calm dawn other nments ~11‘ a.-iusa-la.’ In the Gradual Sayings 2-: 1f

﻿‘An ignorant, ordinary person is sure to die himself and cannot escape death; yet when seeing a dead person, he feels depressed, vexed or repelle-51, being forgetful of his own situation. Now, I too am sure to die and cannot escape death. If when seeing a dead person I should feel depressed, vexed or repelled, that would not be proper for one like myself. When I thus reflected, 0 monks, all pride in life vanished.


Wise consideration of death can also help us see the folly of a,ttachmen.t to an person on to a name. In Bangkok we discussed the J-5.23 Sutta (Sutta Nipgia, vw. 8,04-813) with Khun Sujin


'Short indeed is, this life, this side of an hundred years. one dies; whoever lives long even he dies from old age. People grieve for things they are attached to, yet there exist no permanent p0ss-essions but just a state of (constant) separuti0n....‘,{ls a mag. awakened from sleep no longer sees what happened in his dream, similarly one does not see a loved one who is dead. Those peogale who were seen and heard and called by their names as such and such, only their names remain when fuey have passed away.... A sage who is completely independent does not make close friends nor enemies. In him sorrow and selfishness‘ do not stay, like water on a lotus leaf. As a lotus is not wetted by water, so 2. sage is not affected by what is seen or heard, nnr by what is perceived by the other senses....'


There are many Suttas which discuss the danger of attachment to the body and how death and wise reflection on the corpse can calm the mind. Ii: the-re is. aiome understanding that what one is so attacned to is only nEma.a11d rupa, that is what grill be most helpful. In the Commentary to the Dhammapada. (Kgla junior and Kala senior, Beak One, IPairs) we read. that K515: senimt‘ be-cemes 5: Burninggroundér and attains Arahatship by contemplating izhe corpse of a beautiful girl:

The Elder came and surveyed the lfhere tue flames had touched the flesh, the color of her body that of a mottled cuw; the feet stuck mlt and hung down; the hands. were curled back; the forehead was without skin. The Elder thought to himself, ‘This body which but new caused these who looked thereon to forget the sacred word, has but now attained decay, but now attained» <:§ea1:h....'....' ~

'Imper-manent are all existing things. It is their nature ta come

In the Visudrihirnagga we are alsu reminded of the dangers sf attachment to. life and this 50:11,’. It reminds us abaut the ‘frailty of life’ \Ch.. VIII,

‘This life is impotent and frail. For the life of beings is bound up with the postures, it is bound up with cold and heat, it is bound up with the primary elements, and it is bound up with nutriment.

Life occurs only when the in-breaths and out-breaths occur evenly.

But when. the wind in he nostrils that has gone outside does net go in again, or when that which has gene inside does net acne out again, tuen a man is reckoned ta be dead.‘

It also 5*iesc.ribes (Ch VIII, 29*) how death is ’sign1ess' or inﬂefinanle: ’...The Leaning is that it is unpredictable. in the case of

Khun Sujin reminded us that if death is considered wisely, it can be an gbject of calmness. She pointed out how at the moment of considering someone's death, it can condition calmness instead of trying to force calmness by thinking sf different objects. that death Qomes and that nobody knows when.’ reminded us that ‘dead body is. not always“ the object of calm, but usually

ét is object of aversion... One can read in the Visuddhimagga that there are 40 §bjects of samatha bhﬁvang, but there is no calmness if there is unwise attention» Qt is a condition for aversion, not calmness. So no matter it is the earth fire disc or recollection of the Buddha's virtues or maranaseti or any object samatha, does one really understand how that object can bé object of calmness? Otherwise it will be object of aversion or attachment... The moment of kus»gla is so inert; without awareness there cannot be the development of ca1mness.... some people read Visuddhimagga and think that by concentrating on such:.,and such gbject one will be calm.-1, No understanding at all, so how can one be balm? Tlith no observing at this moment whether it*s calmness or attachment, how can be calm? If there is no calmness at this moment, how can one wish to have lots,‘ of calmness later, because one even know whether this moment is galmness or not. One cannot distinguish moments with lobha, dosa, rmha from Ealmness. '

{Gum Sujin; continues to add that though death can be an object of calmness bne should develop samatha with right understanding of the objects of samatha gnd one should not select. -Otherwise what is this moment?-..Tl1ere is no corpse appearing here now, but there are ‘beings, so this moment can be mett§ instead, of being calm by thinking sf a corpse-.Z.,. Because one keeps on wanting "£0 be calm instead of being caln. right now with understanding of the teachings..-4.


It depends on the present moment what is appearing.... There are enough objects. Study those objects and it can condition calmness in déliiy 1ife....'

We are oft-IL reminded in the teachings that the wise man acts as ‘one whose head is burning‘, knowing ‘death will never fail to.c'e.me’. The Visuddnimagga (Ch. VIII, 36) quotes iron. the'Gre.due.1 Sayings‘ to emphasise how death should be considered as .1 rezinder far the urgency of the development of satipatthanaa
imifulness Gf death thus, ‘Oh let rie live day that I may attend ta the Blessed One"s teacuing, surely much could be done by me‘, and when a bhilmhu develops mindfulness of death thus, ‘Oh let me live as lnng as it takes to eat a meal that I Ylély attend to the Blessed teaching, surely much could be done by me’, and when a bhikkhu develops mindulness of death thus, let we live as long as it takes ta chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls that I may attend to the = Blessed 4)ne's teaching, sure-1y.... -- these are called bhikkhus whu dwell in negligence and slackly develop mindfulness of death for the destruction 01‘ cankers.
And, bhikkhus, when 3 develops mindfulness af death thus, ‘Oh let me live for as lengjas it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful that I may attend to the Blessed 0ne's teaching, sure1y...., and when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus, ‘Oh let me live as long as'it taxes to breathe in and breatm: out, or as long as it takes ta breathe out and breathe in that I gay attenr1.... - these are called who dwell in diligence and keenly develop mindfulness of death for the destruction cf cankefs.
S0 shurt in fact is the extent of life that it is not-certain even for as long as it taxes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls.
This is how death should be recollected as to the limitedness bf extent.’ ,

I was listening ta the tape of discussion from Banares in 1974 about x; it-:ties' ani forgetting that it's just in this one moment of conscIitk taicr. we f2..;i1iar, we tend tc think "i Qia — but inn Anlt nmriv nmr

=======================================================
﻿Zrging on the story, fantasizing. . . the whole thing can go on
and on and on, short or long depending, but in both cases it's just
visible object for a moment and the same with each doorway. Benares, tne Hotel de Paris, this garden and all the people sitting in it talking about Dhamma; put them together n one moment of citta, which is in fact what is happening ‘because we have the concept

of all of that in one moment gf_cit1:a, and thensuagose we die at this moment. and as the citta contaznlng the world, the de Par1s, Banares falls

away, so does Banares, so does the Hotel de Paris, so do all the people sitting in the Hotel do Paris, never to appear again. The only reason that it seems

to us that Banares and the Hotel do Paris and the people sitting in the garden talking about Dhamma exist is because of 'taa ruang' , carrying one the story. . . . '

On the tape, Khun Sujin then reminds everyone to develop awareness, to separate each doorwaw, eyes , ears, nose, tongue body-sense and mind-doer and this. must lead to more detachment,

The Buddha often emphasises the urgency of developing awareness of realities and reminds us of the danger of sense desires. in the Potaliya. (Middle Length Sayings, no. 511) we read:

'. . . . It is as if, a person carrying a flaming torch V L dry-grass; were‘ the wind. What do you .1-hink; 111311891§.that pprson did not get zid of it at once, that-flaming toych (iry grass would burp his hand, or. arm; ‘or same. other par-Q, . of his body; and, in; cpnsequence, He..wQ'ald1 saaﬁfer death, or misery comparable death. ' . ; In exactly the same way, householder; the noble disciple reflects thus: ‘It was said by the Blessed One that sense-desires are like a torch of dry grass‘ . . . . and he cultivates that constant equanimity, dependent on unity, where worldly desires and clinging perish utterly and without a remainder.

Longigg for nappiness and loathing pain, were ta come; and two strung gen were tr; seize that person by each arm and drag him tewards the pit :31‘ glowing embers. ‘flllat dc you thizxk, hcmseholder‘? that person struggle this way and that?. . . '

In the Visudrihimagga we are also reminded about the limitedness of the xte-nt of life and new one shuuld act as if one's head is b11!'ning('Cll. VIII, 35):

e '..the extent Qf human life is short new. Unewho lives long lives a hundred years, more or 1ess. Hence the Blessed One said: 'Bhi£mhus, this human life span is short. There is a new life to be gone to, there are profitable (deeds) to be done, there is the life of purity ‘co be led. There is no not dying for the born. ...‘

‘The life of human kind is short;

‘A wise man holds it in contempt Andi. acts as one whose head is burning; > Death will never fail to come. '

We read in the Gradual Sayings (The Divine Messengers, Book of the Threes,3‘,'-) about the person ‘whose conduct is immoral in deeds, words and thoughts. .3 Being of such immoral conduct, he, on dissolution of the body, after death, is 'rel)0rn in states of wae, in a realm of misery, in the lower worlds, in a hell.‘ seized by bur. arms taken before Yama the Lord (of Death) who asks if he did ma Ite tk flfil iivine of 01:1 age, the second divine messenger of iii Lxiri 1111;: of death. Concerning the last we read:

================================================================

﻿‘Yes, Lord, this I have seen,’

‘Then, my good man, did it never occur to you who are intelligent and old enough, 'I ‘too am subject to death and cannot escape it. Let me now dc noble deeds by body, speech and mind?’

" ‘N0, Lord, I could not do it. I was negligent.‘

‘Through negligence, my good man, you have failed to do noble. deeds by, body, speech and mind.... Well, as it befits your negligence, you will be treated. That evil action of yours was not done by mother or father, brothers‘, sisters , friends or companions, nor by relatives , devas, recluses or brahmins, But you alone have done that evil deed, and you will have to experience the “fruit thereof.

Then, having questioned, examined and addressed the man concerning the third divine messenger, King Yama became silent... Thereupon the warders of hell (inflicted many kinds of torment an him), onwaccuunt of which he suffers grievous. severe, sharp and bitter pain. Yet he does not die until that evil deed of his, has been worked out. '

The underetanding that death can come at any time should be a. reminder to wee the urgency Qf developing all kinds of wholesome mental states. We read; in the Visuddhimagga (IX, 75) that for who sees the value and develops mettE', ‘He dies uncnnfused; there is no dyying deluded for one who abides in lovingkindness. He passes away undeluded. as if falling asleep.‘

I; 3- . " I; 5-2:54 tne life-:4-zsent of living beings is extrsnort, as 11,; as nucn as the occurrence of a single conscious: JIISL as a ghariot wheel, when it is‘ telling, rolls, (that is, tauches the grsun-:1, ) only on one paint of (the circumférence of) its tyre, and, when it is at rest, rests nnly on one point, so ton, the

Im the Minor Readings and Illustrator (Ch IV, 35) , it also emphasises the value of seeing the momentary nature of life as alsa shown in the rest of the Bu<;dha's teachings throughout:

' ‘And one who comes to cliispassioll by seeing (them - six bases in oneself) as void because of the words ‘void village‘. bhikkhus, is a designation far the six bases in (and by seeing then.) as empty and decepare ‘snag; -xi their being as unlasting asibublzvlés, mirglgés, e130,, A W “Elf In and at slfferinx and PZISSES beyond the vision of 1

================================================================
﻿For the arahat who-has eradicated all defilements through fully developed understanding of the realities of life, there is final death. We read in the Mizmr Readings and Illustrator (VI, The Jewel Discourse, 118):

‘The old past-time action (kamma) is, although it has already arisen and ceased, still unconsumed for (ordinary) creatures since it is still capable of inducing their rebirth-lin.king owing to their not having abandoned the (germ-softening) moisture of craving; (but) there are those in whom the moisture of craving has been dried out by the Aranant path and for whom that old action is (thus) consumed, like germs burnt up by fire, since it is no more capable of giving any ripening in the future; tnen any action of theirs occurring right now as honouring tne Enlightened One, etc., is called ’the new‘; (but) they are those for whom it‘ no more gives being since, owing to the abandonment of craving, it is no more capable of fruiting in the future than the flower of a plant whqse roqts have been cut, and these, from whose cognizance lust for new (future) being has faded with the abandoning

of craving are the 1:-hikkhus with taints consumed (exhausted) (called) '(with) the germ c0nsumed' because the (action-resultant) rebirth—1ink— ing consciousness, stated thus...~. has been consumed with the cnnsumption (exilaustirm) of action; and then, because the zeal that there formerly was for the renewal of being calleii ‘gr-owth' has been abandoned precisely by abandoning the arigin (off suffering) they have ne more zeal for grewth formerly had because no mere being is given at the time

The Buddha pointed out how each being is caught in the succession of births and rebirths to endure ‘manifold and various pains’, and ax; ‘joy is it when that succession ends’. By pointing out the ‘advantage of that end, the disaster invol~ ved in that succession‘, the Buddha_instigated us to get beyond birtn, and old age, and disease, and death by jibe realisation of the final end of that successiuzn

of rebirtns. Iiigasena points out to King Milinda that this is the sense which

lewl tae Blessed One ta ins‘! igate us (to put an end £0 life); We read (The Questmi :5 rilizza. IT. 011 Suicide):

We also read in " The Questions of King iuilinda The Fear of Death) that all excepfwthe arahata are attaélifd-ta-'1-ife: ‘Death, great king, is a cnndition which those who have not seen the truth are afraid of. About it this ﬁeople is anxious and full of dread. Whosoever is afraid of a black snake, or an elephant or lion or tiger er leopard or bear or hyena or wild buiffalo or gayal, or of fire or water, or of thorns or spikes or arrdws, it is in each case of death that he is reaily in dread, and therefore afraid of them. This, 0 king, is themajesty of the essential nature of death. And all free from sin are in dread and quake before its majesty. In this sense it is that even the beings in purgatory, who long to be released from it, are afraid of death.‘

1' In Bangkok there was alsn same discussion ahsut fear of death. There can be fear of losing a 'self' or one can be attached to another persanality. We read in the ‘Gradual Sayings‘ (Book of the Fours, Fear of Death, 1:54) that the Branmin J§nuss-rsni thnvght that there ‘is no mortal who does not fear death and is not afraid of it’. The Bu-diiha replies: ':ilzere is, Brahmin, a person who is not free frem lust for sense 51:125. nut free fr-wm the desire and afiectisn for them, not free lI;.; and fer:-ring (after tnea), not free from craving {for if ll“, I! @111 max 1 rnr illnnln ai

===============================================

﻿The Buddha then continues to speak about the person who is not free from lust concerning the body, the person who has not done anything noble and the person who has doubts and perplexity, and has ‘not come to certainty in the Good Law. These three also grieve and are worried and fear death.


‘But which mertal, 0 Brahmin, does not fear death and is not afraid of it‘?

There, is, Brahmin, a person who is free from lust for sense pleasures, free from desire and affection for them, free from thirsting and fevering (after them) , free from craving for sense pleasures. When grave illness befalls him, no such thoughts come to him; ‘Oh, these beloved senae pleasures will leave me and I shall have to leave them! ' Hence he does not grieve and is not worried, t he does not lament and does not bent his breast, nor is he perturbed. This mortal, ‘J Brahmin, is one who does not fear death and is not afraid of it. '

The Buddha continues tn say the same about the who is free from lust concerning the body, the person who has not done anything; evil and the person who has no doubts and perplexity.

‘These, Brahmin, are the four mortals who do net fear death and are not afraid sf it. '

‘Thinking nf death can condition metti instead of being upset. ' Khun. Suj in reminded us of this. If we consider ‘it is the one cert:-1in_ event which all will experience and haw all beings experience suffering and sickness we can have metta. In the Visuddhimagga it talks about I-ewiideath should be understood

as suffering because it is a basis for suffering. We need to be reminded again and again of the urgency of developing right awareness, In the ‘Kindred Sayings!‘ (Ch IX’, 1) we read:

uzderg ne suffering, undergone torment iigei tin. graveyards full) truly, long enough in all the forms of existence, long enough to ‘cairn

them. all.

Znun Suj in often reminds us that ‘life exists in a moment‘ or that ‘this. moment cannet be lost‘ qr ‘this mo;:;.ant is st» real or that ‘life is sq; short, so fragile‘ or asks ‘can you tell what is beyond. this n.-.0ment‘?' . Death can come anytime sc= what abnut ‘right beginning‘? right understanding it cannot be right beginning. Right understanding has to ‘be strong and brave enougl1 ta study any reality. "Elle test is at this m0ment.... Test new! ‘Test this moment whether one has understanding; or whether there should be more understanding deve1oped.... Visual object now is the test of whether there is any understanﬁing

of visual object n0W.... Does visual object appear as just visual object new‘?

It cannot appear as visual object ts mobs.’

We read in the ‘Gradual Sayings‘ (Book ef the Tilrees, 51, Age, Sickness and Death) that when two frail old Brahmins approached the Buddha. He reminds them that:

’Indee€i, Brahmins, this w-vrld is swept away by old age, by sickness and meath. Thcsugb‘ the world thus swept away by old age, sickness M and deatu,*-“self-control self--control in words and self-vcbntrol " irytheughts, these will provide for him who' departs (from this shelter and safety, an refuge and sucoour.
