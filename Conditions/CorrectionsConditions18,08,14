Dear Alan,
 This is a correction of the Conditionality of Life.

12 Kamma and Vipåka-Condition


The term kamma is generally used for good and bad deeds, but kamma is
actually cetanå cetasika, volition. Cetana arises with each citta and it can
therefore be kusala, akusala, vipåka or kiriya. Cetanå directs the associated
dhammas and coordinates their tasks (Atthasåliní, Book I, Part IV, Ch I,
111).
There are two kinds of kamma-condition: conascent kamma-condition
and asynchronous kamma-condition. If we remember that kamma is cetanå
cetasika and that cetanå arises with each citta we can understand what
conascent kamma-condition is. Cetanå which arises with each citta directs
the associated dhammas to accomplish their functions; it conditions these
dhammas by way of conascent kamma-condition, sahajåta kamma-paccaya.
Cetanå which accompanies kusala citta and akusala citta has a double
function: it directs the tasks of the associated dhammas and if it has the
function of “willing” or activity in good and bad deeds. In this last function
it is capable to produce the results of good and bad deeds later on.
Kusala cetanå and akusala cetanå that produce the appropriate results of
good deeds or bad deeds later on condition these results by way of asynchronous
kamma-condition. Thus, this is kamma operating from a different
time (nåùakkhaùika kamma-paccaya), it is different from conascent kamma-
condition.

Cetanå which accompanies kusala citta and akusala citta directs the tasks 
of the associated dhammas and if it is of the intensity to motivate good 
and bad deeds it is capable to produce the appropriate results. 
Kusala cetanå and akusala cetanå that produce the appropriate results of
good deeds or bad deeds condition these results by way of 
asynchronous kamma-condition. Thus, this is kamma operating from a different
time (nåùakkhaùika kamma-paccaya), it is different from conascent kamma-
