This book can be read together with its
commentary, the
``Sammohavinodanī'',
attributed to Buddhaghosa and translated as
``The Dispeller of
Delusion'', in two volumes. The
commentary is most helpful for the understanding of the Abhidhamma, that

``Book of Analysis''
in a lively way with examples from daily
life.
