## What is Buddhism?
Extract from The Buddha's Path, preface.

What is Buddhism? It is different from what most people believe: an Oriental religion full of rituals and ceremonies, which teaches meditation leading to mystical experiences. Buddhism is most practical and matter of fact. The Buddha taught all that is real, all mental phenomena and physical phenomena of our life. By the study of his teachings one learns to investigate ones different mental states which change very rapidly. One comes to know ones faults and vices, even the more subtle ones which are not easily noticeable. One learns what is good and wholesome and how to develop wholesome deeds, speech and thoughts. The Buddha taught on life and death, on the conditions for all phenomena which arise and which are impermanent. He pointed out the suffering and dissatisfaction inherent in the phenomena of life. He explained the true nature of man: a composition of elements which arise and then fall away immediately and which are devoid of an abiding substance, of a self. The Buddha taught the eightfold Path which, if it is developed in the right way, leads to direct understanding of the true nature of all the phenomena of life. It is by direct understanding that defilements can eventually be eradicated

## What is the meaning of the word Buddha?
Extract: Buddhism in Daily Life Chapter 6

What is the meaning of the word Buddha? The Illustrator of Ultimate Meaning (the Paramatthajotika, a commentary to the Minor Readings, Khuddaka Nikaya) explains, in the commentary to the Three Refuges, the meaning of the word Buddha:

... and this is said, Buddha: in what sense Buddha? He is the discoverer (bujjhita) of the Truths, thus he is enlightened (Buddha). He is the enlightener (bodheta) of the generation, thus he is enlightened. He is enlightened by omniscience, enlightened by seeing all, enlightened without being led by others... he is quite without defilement, thus he is enlightened; he has travelled by the Path that goes in only one way, thus he is enlightened; he alone discovered the peerless complete enlightenment, thus he is enlightened; ... Buddha: this is not a name made by a mother, made by a father... this (name) Buddha, which signifies final liberation, is a realistic description of Enlightened Ones, Blessed Ones, together with their obtainment of omniscient knowledge at the root of an enlightenment (tree).

The Buddha is the discoverer of the truth. What is the truth the Buddha discovered all by himself? He is enlightened by omniscience, enlightened by seeing all... the commentary to the Paramatthajotika says. He had developed the wisdom to see and to experience the truth of all things. Everything in life is impermanent and thus it is unsatisfactory. People suffer from old age, sickness and death. In spite of this truth people still cling to the things in and around themselves. Thus they are not able to see reality. The Buddha understood through direct experience that all phenomena which arise fall away immediately. He did not cling to anything at all.

## What the use is of knowing the details about citta and cetasikas?
Extract from Cetasikas: Introduction

The reader may wonder what the use is of knowing the details about citta and cetasikas. Citta and cetasikas are not abstract categories, they are active at this very moment. We could not see, hear, think, act, be angry or have attachment without cetasikas. Seeing, for example, is a citta. It is the citta which cognizes colour or visible object. In order to perform its function it needs the assistance of cetasikas, such as contact, which contacts visible object, or one-pointedness, which focuses on the object. It is important to have more understanding of cetasikas. We should know that defilements are cetasikas and that good qualities are cetasikas. They arise in daily life and when they appear we should investigate their characteristics. Otherwise we would not know what is right and what is wrong. We would not know when defilements arise and how deeply rooted they are. If the Buddha had not taught in detail about defilements we would only have a vague idea about them. How could we see the danger of defilements when they are unknown to us? How could we develop what is wholesome if we would not know the characteristics of wholesome cetasikas and the different ways of good deeds?
## What is Abhidhamma?
Extract from the Preface of Abhidhamma in Daily Life

As regards the Abhidhamma, this is an exposition of all realities in 
detail. The prefix ´abhi is used in the sense of `preponderance' or 
`distinction'. `Abhidhamma' means `higher dhamma' or ´dhamma in detail´.
 The form of this part of the Tipitaka is different, but the aim is the 
same: the eradication of wrong view and eventually of all defilements. 
Thus, when we study the many enumerations of realities, we should not 
forget the real purpose of our study. The theory (pariyatti) should 
encourage us to the practice (patipatti) which is necessary for the 
realization of the truth (pativedha). While we are studying the 
different mental phenomena (namas) and physical phenomena (rupas) and while we are pondering over them, we can be reminded to be aware of the nama and rupa which appear at that moment. In this way we will discover more and more that the Abhidhamma explains everything which is real, that is, the `worlds' appearing through the six doors of the senses and the mind. 
This book is meant as an introduction to the study of the 
Abhidhamma. In order to understand this book, some basic knowledge of 
Buddhism is necessary. My book The Buddha's Path could be helpful to 
make the reader acquainted with the basic principles and tenets of 
Buddhism before he starts to read this book on the Abhidhamma. 
## What is Kamma (karma)?
The Pali term kamma, also known in its Sanskrit form karma, literally 
means action or deed. A good deed brings a pleasant result and a bad 
deed brings an unpleasant result. The results of our own deeds come to 
us sooner or later, this is the law of kamma and result, and nobody can 
alter the operation of this law. The Buddhas teaching on kamma and 
result is difficult to grasp. It is not a dogma one has to accept. There
 can be theoretical understanding of kamma and result, but by 
theoretical understanding this law cannot be fully comprehended. Only by direct understanding of the physical phenomena and mental phenomena of our life the condition of kamma which produces result can be seen more clearly. Therefore it should not be expected that the law of kamma and result can be fully understood when we begin to investigate the Buddhas teaching on this subject.

A deed done in the past can produce result later on. Kamma can be compared to a seed developing into a tree which bears fruit later on. Evenso, a bad deed, for example killing, can produce an unpleasant result such as illness or pain. A good deed, for example a deed of generosity, can produce a pleasant result, such as the receiving of beautiful things. When we think of a deed and its result we usually think of a deed which has an effect on someone else. In order
 to understand the law of kamma and its result we should not think in 
terms of the conventional realities of persons and situations, but we 
should have understanding of the ultimate realities of cittas and their 
accompanying mental factors and of physical phenomena, realities which arise and then fall away immediately. We cannot be sure whether someone else performs kusala kamma or not from the outward appearance of things.
We may see someone else giving things away but there may not be the 
performing of a deed of generosity. The giving may be motivated by 
selfish motives, and then giving is not kusala kamma. It is the 
wholesome or unwholesome intention or volition which constitutes kusala kamma or akusala kamma. The terms kusala kamma and akusala kamma can be used in the sense of good deeds and evil deeds, but when we are more precise kamma is the intention or volition motivating deeds performed through bodily action, through speech and through the mind. When we speak of the different types of kusala kamma and akusala kamma we shoul remember that kamma is intention or volition, a mental reality. Kamma is a mental factor accompanying citta, and it arises and falls away together with the citta.

How can a deed performed in the past produce its result later on? Kamma, or the volition which accompanies the citta when a good deed or a bad deed is performed, falls away immediately together with the citta. However, since each citta which falls away is succeeded by the next citta, kamma can be accumulated from moment to moment. Its dynamic force is carried on and when the time is ripe it can produce its result. That is the chain of causal action we read about in the above quoted sutta. The same sutta mentions the kinds of akusala kamma performed through body, speech and mind. Not every akusala citta is of the intensity of akusala kamma which can produce a result. When there is clinging to a pleasant sight or sound there is akusala citta but not akusala kamma which could produce a result. 
Clinging, however, has many degrees. It can be more subtle or it can be 
strong, such as covetousness, the desire for someone elses property. 
This has the intensity of akusala kamma when one plans to take away what belongs to someone else. Kusala kamma comprises abstaining from evil deeds as well as the performing of good deeds, deeds of generosity and mental development, such as the study of the Buddhas teachings and the development of understanding of the realities of our life.
Moments of happiness and misery alternate in our life. The experiences of pleasant objects and unpleasant objects through the senses do not occur by chance, they must have a cause: kamma is the cause. We read in the Gradual Sayings (IV, Book of the Eights, Chapter I, 5, Worldly Failings) that the Buddha said to the monks:

Monks, these eight worldly conditions obsess the world; the world revolves round these eight worldly conditions. What eight?

Gain and loss, fame and obscurity, blame and praise, bodily ease and 
pain. Monks, these eight worldly conditions obsess the world, the world 
revolves round these eight worldly conditions.
 Gain, loss, obscurity and fame,
 And censure, praise, bodily ease, pain-
 These are mans statesimpermanent,
 Of time and subject unto change.
 And recognizing these the sage,
 Alert, discerns these things of change;
 Fair things his mind never agitate,
 Nor foul his spirit vex. Gone are
 Compliance and hostility,
 Gone up in smoke and are no more.
 The goal he knows. In measure full
 He knows the stainless, griefless state.
 Beyond becoming has he gone.

The person who has reached the state of perfection has equanimity towards the vicissitudes of life. He is freed from the chain of causal action, there is no more rebirth for him. So long as one is full of attachment, aversion and ignorance, one wants pleasant objects and dislikes unpleasant objects. However, the experience of pleasant objects and unpleasant objects is not in any ones power, it depends on kamma which produces result. One day there is gain, the next day loss; one day there is praise, the next day blame. Sometimes we are healthy, sometimes we suffer from sickness and pain. The experience of pleasant or unpleasant objects through the senses is not a reward or a punishment. The idea of reward or punishment stems from the conception of a supreme being, a God, who is the judge of mans deeds. The cause of the experience of pleasant and unpleasant objects through the senses is within ourselves: it is kamma. There is seeing and hearing of pleasant and unpleasant objects time and again. Seeing and hearing are the results of kusala kamma or akusala kamma. These results arise just for a moment and then they fall away. When we define what was seen or heard or think of the nature of the object, the moments of result have fallen away already. It is hard to tell whether seeing or hearing is the result of kusala kamma or of akusala kamma. Thinking of what was seen or heard is not result; when there is thinking there is kusala citta or akusala citta, but mostly akusala citta. In order to understand the ultimate realities of kamma and its result we have to be very precise. Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and the experience of tangible object through the bodysense are cittas which are results of kamma. Our reactions in a wholesome or in an unwholesome way to the objects which are experienced are not results of kamma, they are kusala citta or akusala citta. Kusala citta and akusala citta can be called the active side of life, since they can perform good deeds and bad deeds which will cause the appropriate results later on. The cittas which are results of ones deeds can be called the passive side of life. We have to receive results, whether we like it or not.

Cittas arise because of their own conditions, they are beyond control. Sometimes it seems that we ourselves can cause the enjoyment of pleasant objects. However, there have to be the right conditions for the enjoyment of pleasant objects and enjoyment cannot last as long as we wish. We can enjoy pleasant music by turning on the radio, but kamma is the cause of hearing, not a self. It also depends on conditions whether we can afford a radio or not. One may live in poverty and not be able to afford a radio. It is due to kamma if one is born into a poor family and has to live in uncomfortable circumstances. It is due to kamma if one is born into a family which is well-to-do and if one can live in comfort.

In order to understand that birth into pleasant surroundings and in 
unpleasant surroundings is the result of kamma we have to go back to the first moment of a lifespan. There was a citta at the first moment of 
our life, and this is the rebirth-consciousness. This citta must have a 
cause and the cause is in the past, it is kamma. Birth is result, we 
could not select our parents, nor time and place of our birth. The first
 moment of life is called rebirth-consciousness because there is not 
only this present life, there were also past lives. It is difficult to 
understand that kamma of the past produces the birth of a being. We can notice, however, that people are born into different circumstances, with different bodily features and different mental capacities. This does 
not happen by chance, there must be conditions for such differences. 
There are different kammas which cause different kinds of birth. In the 
Discourse on the Lesser Analysis of Deeds (Middle Length Sayings III, 
number 135) we read that Subha asks the Buddha what the cause is of the different results human beings experience from the time of their birth:

Now, good Gotama, what is the cause, what is the reason that lowness 
and excellence are to be seen among human beings while they are in human form? For, good Gotama, human beings of short lifespan are to be seen and those of long lifespan; those of many and those of few illnesses; those who are ugly, those who are beautiful; those who are of little account, those of great account; those who are poor, those who are 
wealthy; those who are of lowly families, those of high families; those 
who are weak in wisdom, those who are full of wisdom.
The Buddha answered Subha:

 Deeds are ones own, brahman youth, beings are heirs to deeds, deeds are
 matrix, deeds are kin, deeds are arbiters. Deed divides beings, that is
 to say by lowness and excellence.

Some people are born in countries where there is war and famine, others in countries where there is peace and prosperity. This does not happen by chance; kamma, a deed performed in the past, is the cause. If kamma is the cause of birth, what is then the role of the parents? Parents are also a condition for the birth of a child, but they are not the only condition. Kamma produces at the first moment of life the citta which is the rebirth-consciousness. The new human being which comes to life consists of mental phenomena and bodily phenomena. The physical phenomena which arise at the first moment of life must also have a cause: kamma is the cause. Thus, at the first moment of life there is mental result as well as physical result of kamma. Kamma is not the only factor from which bodily phenomena originate. There are four factors in all: kamma, citta, temperature and nutrition. After kamma has produced bodily phenomena at the first moment of life, the other factors also produce bodily phenomena. As to the factor of temperature, there has to be the right temperature for the new being in the womb in order to develop. When the 
mother takes food, nutrition is suffused in the body and then nutrition 
is also producing bodily phenomena for the being in the womb. Citta is a
 condition as well for bodily phenomena arising throughout our life. If 
there were no citta we could not stay alive, we could not move, we could
 not perform any activities. If we remember the four factors which 
produce bodily phenomena, namely kamma, citta, temperature and 
nutrition, it will help us to understand that the body does not belong 
to a self. What we call my body consists of bodily phenomena which arise
 because of different conditions and then fall away. Kamma produces 
bodily phenomena at the first moment of a lifespan and also throughout 
life. It is kamma which produces the sense organs of eyesense, earsense,
 smellingsense, tastingsense and bodysense. The sense organs which are 
the physical results of kamma are the means for the experiences which 
are the mental results of kamma: seeing, hearing and the other sense 
impressions. Thus, kamma produces result at the first moment of life, it
 produces the births of beings, and in the course of life it also 
produces pleasant and unpleasant results in the form of experiences 
through the senses.

Kamma can cause rebirth in unhappy and in 
happy planes of existence. Besides the human plane of existence there 
are other planes of existence. Birth in an unhappy plane is the result 
of akusala kamma and birth in a happy plane is the result of kusala 
kamma. Hell planes and the animal world, for example, are unhappy 
planes. The human plane and heavenly planes are happy planes. It may be 
felt by some that the existence of hell planes and heavenly planes is 
mythology. It should be remembered that conventional terms are used to 
designate different degrees of unpleasant results and pleasant results 
of kamma. Birth in a hell plane is an unhappy rebirth because in such a 
plane there are conditions for the experience of intense suffering. 
Birth in a heavenly plane is a happy rebirth because in such a plane 
there are conditions for the experience of pleasant objects. Life in a 
hell plane or in a heavenly plane does not last forever. There will be 
rebirth again and it depends on kamma in which plane 
rebirth-consciousness will arise. Birth in the human plane is the result
 of kusala kamma, but in the course of life there are conditions for the
 experience of both pleasant and unpleasant objects through the senses, 
depending on the different kammas which produce them.

It may 
happen that someone who has obtained wealth with dishonest means lives 
in luxury. How can bad deeds have pleasant results? It is not possible 
for us to find out which deed of the past produces its corresponding 
result at present. A criminal can receive pleasant results but these are
 caused by good deeds. His bad deeds will produce unpleasant results but
 it is not known when. In the course of many lives good deeds and bad 
deeds were performed and we do not know when it is the right time for a 
particular kamma to produce result. A good deed or a bad deed may not 
produce result during the life it was performed, but it may produce 
result in the following life or even after countless lives have passed. 
In the scriptures it is said that when kamma has ripened its fruit is 
experienced. We read in the Dhammapada, (verses 119 and 120):

 Even an evil-doer sees good so long as evil ripens not; but when it bears fruit, then he sees the evil results.
 Even a good person sees evil so long as good ripens not; but when it bears fruit, then the good one sees the good results.

Several
 other conditions are needed for akusala kamma or kusala kamma to 
produce their appropriate results. The time when one is born or the 
place where one is born can be a favourable or an unfavourable condition
 for kusala kamma or for akusala kamma to produce result. For example, 
when one lives in a time of war there are more conditions for akusala 
kamma and less conditions for kusala kamma to produce result. A 
particular kamma may be prevented from producing result when there is a 
very powerful counteractive kamma which has preponderance. For example, 
when someone is wealthy and lives in comfort, there are pleasant results
 for him, caused by kusala kamma. However, he may suddenly lose his 
wealth and be forced to live in miserable circumstances. His loss is 
caused by akusala kamma which has ripened so that it can produce 
unpleasant result. This is an example which shows that the way different
 kinds of kamma operate in our life is most intricate.
## Should Buddhists be vegetarians?
From The Buddha's Path, chapter 6

Does this mean that Buddhists 
should be vegetarians? The Buddha did not teach people to abstain from 
eating meat. The monks had to accept any kind of food which was offered 
to them by the layfollowers. The Buddha explained to the monks that they
 could eat meat unless they had seen, heard or suspected that an animal 
was killed especially for them. We read in the Book of Discipline 
(Vinaya IV, Maha-vagga VI, on Medicines, 237) that the general Siha 
attained enlightenment after having listened to the Buddha. He offered a
 meal which included meat to the Buddha and the order of monks. The 
Niganthas, who were of another teaching, found fault with the offering 
of meat. We read that after the meal the Buddha explained to the monks:

 Monks, one should not knowingly make use of meat killed on purpose (for
 one). Whoever should make use of it, there is an offence of 
wrong-doing. I allow you, monks, fish and meat that are quite pure in 
three respects: if they are not seen, heard, suspected (to have been 
killed on purpose for a monk).

This answer may not be 
satisfactory to everyone. One may wonder whether one indirectly promotes
 the slaughtering of animals by buying meat. It would be good if there 
were no slaughtering at all, no violence. The world, however, is not an 
Utopia. Animals are slaughtered and their meat is sold. If one in the 
given situation buys meat and eats it, one does not commit an act of 
violence. While one kills there is akusala citta rooted in aversion; 
killing is an act of violence. While one eats meat there may be 
attachment or dislike of it, but there is no act of violence towards a 
living being.
## What is meditation?
Extract from Buddhism in Daily Life, Chapter 5.

The Buddha said 
that one should realize the impermanence of all things. Everybody is 
subject to old age, sickness and death. All things are susceptible to 
change. What one is enjoying today may be changed tomorrow. Many people 
do not want to face this truth; they are too attached to the pleasant 
things they can enjoy through eyes, ears, nose, tongue and bodysense. 
They do not realize that these things are not true happiness. The Buddha
 cured peoples ignorance by helping them to have right understanding 
about their life; he taught them Dhamma. The Buddha taught different 
ways of developing wholesomeness: dana or generosity, sila or morality 
and bhavana or mental development. Bhavana is a way of kusala kamma 
which is on a higher level, because wisdom is developed through bhavana.

One
 may wonder why wisdom, panna, is essential. The answer is that only 
understanding things as they are can eliminate ignorance. Out of 
ignorance people take what is unwholesome for wholesome. Ignorance 
causes sorrow. The Buddha always helped people to have right 
understanding of their different cittas (consciousness). He explained 
what akusala (unwholesome) cittas and kusala (wholesome) cittas are, in 
order that people could develop more wholesomeness.

We can verify
 in our life that the Buddha taught the truth. His teachings are true 
not only for Buddhists, but for everybody, no matter what race or 
nationality he is or what religion he professes. Attachment or greed (in
 Pali: lobha), aversion or anger (in Pali: dosa) and ignorance (in Pali:
 moha) are common to everybody, not only to Buddhists. Should not 
everyone eradicate lobha, dosa and moha?

People do not always 
realize that lobha, dosa and moha lead to sorrow. They may recognize 
unwholesomeness when it is coarse, but not when it is more subtle. For 
example, they may know that the citta is unwholesome when there is lobha
 which is as coarse as greed or lust, but they do not recognize lobha 
when it is more subtle, such as attachment to beautiful things or to 
dear people. Why is it unwholesome to have attachment to our relatives 
and friends? It is true that we are bound to have lobha, but we should 
realize that attachment is not the same as pure loving-kindness (in 
Pali: metta). When we think that we have pure loving-kindness, there can
 be moments of attachment too. Attachment is not wholesome; it will 
sooner or later bring unhappiness. Although people may not like to see 
this truth, one day they will experience that lobha brings unhappiness. 
Through death we are bound to lose people who are dear to us. And when 
sickness or old age affect our sense faculties we may no longer be able 
to enjoy beautiful things through eyes and ears.

If we do not 
have the right understanding of the realities of life we will not know 
how to bear the loss of dear people. We read in the Udana (Verses of 
Uplift, Ch VIII, Paialigama, 8, Khuddaka Nikaya) that, while the Buddha 
was staying near Savatthi in East Park, at the storeyed house of Migaras
 mother, Visakha came to see him. Visakha who had lost her 
grand-daughter came to see the Buddha with wet clothes and wet hair. The
 Buddha said:

 Why, Visakha! How is it that you come here with clothes and hair still wet at an unseasonable hour?

 O, sir, my dear and lovely grand-daughter is dead! That is why I come 
here with hair and clothes still wet at an unseasonable hour.
 Visakha, would you like to have as many sons and grandsons as there are men in Savatthi?
 Yes, sir, I would indeed!
 But how many men do you suppose die daily in Savatthi?

 Ten, sir, or maybe nine, or eight. Maybe seven, six, five or four, 
three, two; may be one a day dies in Savatthi, sir. Savatthi is never 
free from men dying, sir.
 What think you, Visakha? In such case 
would you ever be without wet hair and clothes? Surely not, sir! Enough 
for me, sir, of so many sons and grandsons!
 Visakha, whoso have a 
hundred things beloved, they have a hundred sorrows. Whoso have ninety, 
eighty... thirty, twenty things beloved... whoso have ten... whoso have 
but one thing beloved, have but one sorrow. Whoso have no thing beloved,
 they have no sorrow. Sorrowless are they and passionless. Serene are 
they, I declare.

People who see that it is unwholesome to be 
enslaved by attachment to people and to the things around themselves, 
want to develop more understanding of realities by applying themselves 
to bhavana, mental development. Studying the Buddhas teachings and 
explaining them to others is kusala kamma included in bhavana. In 
studying the teachings panna will be developed. If we want to understand
 what the Buddha taught it is essential to read the scriptures as they 
have come down to us at the present time in the Three Collections: the 
Vinaya, the Suttanta and the Abhidhamma. Study alone, however, is not 
enough. We should experience the truth of Dhamma in daily life. Only 
then will we know things as they really are. Teaching Dhamma to other 
people is kusala kamma of a high degree. In this way one not only helps 
others to have more understanding about their life, one develops ones 
own understanding as well. Teaching Dhamma is the most effective way of 
helping other people to develop kusala and to eradicate akusala.

Another
 way of kusala kamma included in bhavana is the development of calm or 
samatha bhavana. In samatha there are specific meditation subjects which
 can condition the calm which is temporary freedom from lobha, dosa and 
moha. One must have right understanding of the meditation subject and of
 the way to become calm. When samatha has been highly developed 
different stages of jhana or absorption can be attained. However, the 
attainment of jhana is extremely difficult and one must have accumulated
 the right conditions in order to attain it. When the citta is 
jhanacitta there are no lobha, dosa and moha. Jhana is kusala kamma of a
 high degree. Jhana is not the same as a trance which might be 
experienced after taking certain drugs. Those who take drugs want to 
obtain the desired end in an easy way and their action is prompted by 
lobha. Those who apply themselves to samatha have the sincere wish to 
purify themselves of lobha, dosa and moha; they do not look for 
sensational or thrilling experiences.

Samatha can purify the 
mind, but it cannot eradicate unwholesome latent tendencies. When the 
citta is not jhanacitta, lobha, dosa and moha are bound to arise again. 
The person who applies himself to samatha cannot eradicate the belief in
 a self, and so long as there is the concept of self, defilements cannot
 be eradicated.

The clinging to the concept of self can only be 
eradicated through vipassana. Vipassana or insight meditation is another
 way of kusala kamma included in bhavana. Through the development of 
vipassana ignorance of realities is eliminated. One learns to see things
 as they are in being aware, for example, when one sees, hears, smells, 
tastes, when one receives impressions through the bodysense or when one 
thinks. When we experience that all things in ourselves and around 
ourselves are only mental phenomena or nama and physical phenomena or 
rupa which arise and fall away, we will be less inclined to take them 
for self.

What is the reason that we all are inclined to cling to
 a self? The reason is that because of our ignorance we do not know 
things as they really are. When we hear a sound, we are ignorant of the 
different phenomena which occur during the moment we are hearing that 
sound. We think that it is a self who is hearing. However, it is not a 
self who is hearing; it is a citta which hears the sound. Citta is a 
mental phenomenon, it is nama, that is, the reality which experiences 
something. The citta which hears experiences sound. Sound itself does 
not experience anything, it is rupa. Rupa is the reality which does not 
experience anything. Sound and earsense are conditions for hearing. 
Earsense is rupa as well. One may wonder whether it is true that 
earsense does not experience anything. Earsense is a kind of rupa in the
 ear which has the capacity to receive sound, but it does not experience
 the sound. It is only a condition for the nama which experiences the 
sound. Each citta has its own conditions through which it arises. Seeing
 is conditioned by eyesense which is rupa and by visible object which is
 also rupa. There is no self who performs different functions such as 
seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, receiving impressions through the 
bodysense and thinking. These are different namas, each of which arises 
because of its own conditions. 
## What is the origin of the Buddhist texts of the Theravada tradition?
Extract from The Buddha's Path, preface.

What is the origin of 
the Buddhist texts of the Theravada tradition as they have come to us 
today? These texts date from the Buddhas time, about 2500 years ago. 
Shortly after the Buddhas passing away a Council was held in Rajagaha, 
were the teachings were examined and scrutinized as to their orthodoxy. 
Under the leadership of the Buddhas eminent disciple Maha Kassapa five 
hundred monks who had reached the state of perfection recited all the 
texts of the Vinaya, the Book of Discipline for the monks, the Suttanta,
 Discourses, and the Abhidhamma, the higher teaching on ultimate 
realities. A second Council was held one century later at Vesali. This 
was necessary because of wrong interpretations of the monkss rules by 
heretical monks. A third Council was held in 268 B.C. in Pataliputta. On
 this occasion the canon of the Theravada tradition in the Pali language
 as it exists today was finally redacted. During all this time the 
teachings were handed down by oral tradition. About 89 B.C. they were 
committed to writing in Sri Lanka. 
## What are the conditions for enlightenment?
Extract Abhidhamma in Daily Life, chapter 24.

One cannot attain 
enlightenment without having cultivated the right conditions. We read in
 the Kindred Sayings (V, Maha-vagga, Book XI, Kindred Sayings on 
Streamwinning, chapter I, 5, Sariputta) about four conditions for 
becoming a sotapanna (streamwinner). The sutta states:

 Now the 
venerable Sariputta went to see the Exalted One, and on coming to him 
saluted him and sat down at one side. To the venerable Sariputta so 
seated the Exalted One said this:
 A limb of stream-winning! A limb 
of stream-winning! is the saying, Sariputta. Tell me, Sariputta, of what
 sort is a limb of stream-win.
 Lord, association with the upright is
 a limb of stream-winning. Hearing the good Dhamma is a limb of 
stream-winning. Applying the mind is a limb of stream-winning. 
Conforming to the Dhamma is a limb of stream-winning.
 Well said, 
Sariputta! Well said, Sariputta! Indeed these are limbs of 
stream-winning. Now again, Sariputta, they say: The stream! The stream! 
Of what sort is the stream, Sariputta?
 The stream, lord, is just 
this ariyan eightfold way, to wit: Right view, right thought, right 
speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness,
 right concentration.
 Well said, Sariputta! Well said, Sariputta! 
The stream is just this ariyan eightfold way. Now again, Sariputta, they
 say, Streamwinner! Streamwinner! Of what sort is a streamwinner, 
Sariputta?
 Whosoever, lord, is blessed with this ariyan eightfold 
waysuch an one of such a name, of such and such a clan, is called 
Streamwinner.

The first condition, association with the righteous
 person, is most important. It would not be possible to find the right 
path by oneself. Only Buddhas have accumulated such wisdom that they can
 find the Path by themselves, without the help of a teacher. Other 
people, however, need the teachings of a Buddha in order to find the 
right path, because ignorance has been accumulated for an endlessly long
 time. We need association with the right person, the good friend in 
Dhamma, who can point out to us the right path, because our defilements 
prevent us from finding the right path. Our friend in Dhamma can 
encourage us to develop right understanding of nama and rupa.

The
 question may arise what one should do if one is not able to find the 
right friend in Dhamma. Is reading the scriptures not a condition to 
find the path leading to enlightenment? It is true that reading the 
scriptures is also very helpful since they can encourage us to be 
mindful of nama and rupa in daily life. We might, however, interpret the
 teachings in the wrong way. It depends on conditions whether we come 
into contact with the right person who can help us to understand the 
teachings as well as the practice in accordance with the teachings. 
Accumulated kusala kamma can be the condition for us to meet the right 
person.

When we have heard the Dhamma from the right person, we 
should apply the mind; this is the third condition. We should not 
blindly follow the person who teaches us Dhamma, but we should 
investigate the scriptures ourselves, ponder over the Dhamma, and 
consider it carefully, in order to test the truth.

The real test 
of the truth is the practice itself. Therefore, the fourth condition is 
conforming to the Dhamma, which is the development of the eightfold 
Path. By being mindful of the phenomena appearing through the six doors 
we can find out ourselves whether it is true that these phenomena are 
only nama and rupa, arising because of conditions. We can investigate 
ourselves whether they are impermanent or permanent, whether they are 
dukkha or happiness, whether they are non-self, anatta, or self. We can 
find out through the practice itself whether we really understand the 
teachings. If we practise in the wrong way we may eventually find out 
that this does not lead to right understanding of the realities of our 
daily life. Through the development of the eightfold Path we will have 
more confidence (saddha) in the Buddhas teachings. We will have more 
confidence when we experience that through right understanding of nama 
and rupa in daily life there will be less clinging to self. 
## Can there be a free will?
It is inevitable that questions arise with regard to the implication of 
the truth of non-self in ones life. People generally have questions as 
to the existence of a free will. If there is no self, only empty 
phenomena which appear and disappear, can there be a free will, can one 
have a free choice in the taking of decisions in life? Are a free will 
and self-control not essential elements of human life? The truth of 
non-self seems to imply that ones whole life is determined, even 
predestined, by conditions. The answer is that a free will presupposes a
 lasting personality who can exert power over his will. Since there is 
no self, merely impermanent phenomena arising because of conditions, 
there is no free will independent of conditions. The will or desire to 
act can be wholesome at one moment and unwholesome at another moment. 
When there is anger, there is volition which is unwholesome, and it can 
instigate words of anger. When there is generosity, there is volition 
which is wholesome, it can motivate deeds of generosity. There can be 
the decision to do particular things, such as the development of 
generosity or of understanding, but there is no person who decides to do
 this. There are different moments of decision arising because of 
different conditions. What one decides to do depends on past 
accumulations of wholesomeness and unwholesomeness, on ones education, 
on the friends one associates with. It may be felt that, since 
accumulations of wholesomeness and unwholesomeness in the past condition
 ones actions, speech and thoughts today, one would be a helpless victim
 of these accumulated conditions. What is the sense of life if 
everything is determined. So long as there is clinging to a concept of 
self there is enslavement, no freedom. When understanding is developed 
which can eliminate the clinging to a self one becomes really free. Also
 the development of understanding is conditioned, it is conditioned by 
previous moments of understanding, by association with someone who can 
explain the Dhamma, by the study of the Buddhist teachings. Whatever we 
think or do is dependent on conditions which operate in our life in an 
intricate way. The seventh book of the Abhidhamma deals entirely with 
the different conditions for all mental and physical phenomena of life, 
with the aim to help people to have more understanding of these 
conditions. Even freedom is dependent on conditions. The more 
understanding of realities develops, the more will there be the letting 
go of clinging to the importance of self, the clinging to wrong 
perceptions of reality. Eventually all defilements can be eradicated by 
right understanding and is this not what can be called the highest 
freedom? 
## What is the Buddhist answer to the problem of suffering?
Extract from The Buddha's Path, chapter1.

The Buddha gave his 
own, unique answer to the problem of suffering. He taught that the cause
 of suffering is within man, namely his own faults and defilements, and 
not in the external situation. He explained that only profound knowledge
 of his own mind and of all phenomena of his life can lead to the end of
 suffering. We read in the Buddhist scriptures (Kindred Sayings I, 
Chapter III, Kosala, Part 3, 3, The World) that King Pasenadi had a 
conversation with the Buddha at Savatthi about the cause of suffering. 
We read:

 How many kinds of things, lord, that happen in the world, make for trouble, for suffering, for distress?

 Three things, sire, happen of that nature. What are the three? Greed, 
hate, and delusion these three make for trouble, for suffering, for 
distress.

The outward circumstances cannot be changed, but the 
inward attitude towards the vicissitudes of life can be changed. Wisdom 
can be developed and this can eventually eradicate completely greed, 
hate and delusion. This wisdom is not developed by speculation about the
 truth of life, it is developed through the direct experience of the 
phenomena of life as they really are, including ones own mental states. 
That is the Path the Buddha taught, but it takes time to understand how 
it is to be developed. The Buddha was not a God, not a saviour, who 
wanted people to follow him without questioning the truth of his 
teaching. He showed the Path to the understanding of the truth, but 
people had to investigate the truth and develop the Path themselves. We 
read in the scriptures (Dialogues of the Buddha, II, 16, the Book of the
 Great Decease) that the Buddha said to his disciple Ananda:

Therefore, Ananda, be an island to yourselves, a refuge to yourselves, 
seeking no external refuge; with the Teaching as your island, the 
Teaching as your refuge, seeking no other refuge.

The Buddha explained that in developing the Path one is ones own refuge.

Extract from Buddhism in Daily Life, chapter 9.

We
 read in the Kindred Sayings (V, Maha-vagga, Book XII, Kindred Sayings 
about the Truths, Ch II, 1) that the Buddha explained the Four Noble 
Truths (ariya sacca) to his first five disciples in the Deerpark in 
Varanasi. The first Noble Truth is the Truth of dukkha which can be 
translated as suffering or unsatisfactoriness. The Buddha said:

 Now this, monks, is the ariyan truth about dukkha:

 Birth is dukkha, decay is dukkha, sickness is dukkha, death is dukkha; 
likewise sorrow and grief, woe, lamentation and despair. To be conjoined
 with things we dislike, to be separated from things we like that also 
is dukkha. Not to get what one wants that also is dukkha. In a word, the
 five khandhas which are based on grasping are dukkha.

The 
five khandhas, which are the mental phenomena and the physical phenomena
 in and around ourselves, are dukkha. One may wonder why they are 
dukkha. We take the mind for self, but what we call our mind are only 
mental elements or namas which arise and then fall away immediately. We 
take the body for self, but what we call our body are only physical 
elements or rupas which arise and fall away. When we do not know the 
truth we think that these phenomena can stay; we take them for self. We 
might for instance think that sadness stays, but there is not only 
sadness, there are many other phenomena such as seeing, hearing and 
thinking. What we think is a long time of sadness is, in reality, many 
different phenomena succeeding one another; none of these phenomena 
stays.

Phenomena which are impermanent are not real happiness; so
 they are dukkha. Although dukkha is often translated as suffering, it 
is not only an unhappy feeling; the first Noble Truth pertains to all 
phenomena which arise and fall away. There is not anything in our life 
which is not dukkha. Even happy feeling is dukkha; it does not last. The
 second Noble Truth is the origin of dukkha, which is craving. The same 
sutta states:

 Now this, monks, is the ariyan truth about the 
arising of dukkha: It is that craving that leads back to birth, along 
with the lure and the lust that lingers longingly now here, now there: 
namely the craving for sensual pleasure, the craving to be born again, 
the craving for existence to end. Such, monks, is the ariyan truth about
 the arising of dukkha.

So long as there is craving in any form 
there will be a condition for life, for the arising of nama and rupa. 
Thus, there will be dukkha.

The third Noble Truth is the cessation of dukkha, which is nibbana. We read in the above quoted sutta:

 And this, monks, is the ariyan truth about the ceasing of dukkha: 
Verily it is the utter passionless cessation of, the giving up, the 
forsaking, the release from, the absence of longing for this craving.

Craving
 is the origin of dukkha, whereas when there is the cessation of craving
 there will be the extinction of rebirth and thus of dukkha. Nibbana is 
the end of dukkha. The arahat has, at the attainment of enlightenment 
eradicated all craving and thus for him there are no more conditions for
 rebirth, and that means the end of dukkha.

We read in the same sutta about the fourth Noble Truth:

 Now this, monks, is the ariyan truth about the practice that leads to the ceasing of dukkha:

 Verily it is the ariyan eightfold way, namely: Right understanding, 
right thinking, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right 
effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.

The eightfold 
Path (ariya-magga) is the development of right understanding of all 
phenomena which appear in our daily life. We come to know the world in 
and around ourselves, not through speculation, but from our own 
experience. How do we experience the world? We experience the world 
through seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, receiving impressions 
through the bodysense and through the mind. Everything we experience 
through the doors of the five senses and through the mind-door is 
extremely short, because all phenomena which arise fall away 
immediately. When we see, there is the world of visible object, but it 
does not last, it falls away again. When we hear, there is the world of 
sound, but it is impermanent. Likewise the world of smell, the world of 
taste, the world of tangible object and the world of mental objects; 
none of these worlds lasts.

In the Visuddhimagga (VIII, 39) we read about the shortness of the world:

 ...in the ultimate sense the life-moment of living beings is extremely 
short, being only as much as the occurrence of a single conscious 
moment. Just as a chariot wheel, when it is rolling, rolls (that is, 
touches the ground) only on one point of (the circumference of) its 
tyre, and, when it is at rest, rests only on one point, so too, the life
 of living beings lasts only for a single conscious moment. When that 
consciousness has ceased, the being is said to have ceased...
 Life, person, pleasure, painjust these alone
 Join in one conscious moment that flicks by.
 Ceased khandhas of those dead or alive
 Are all alike, gone never to return.
 No (world is) born if (consciousness is) not
 Produced, when that is present, then it lives;
 When consciousness dissolves, the world is dead...
## In what way does Buddhism differ from other mainstream religions?
Extract from The Buddha's Path chapter 3

The truth of non-self, 
in Pali anatta, is an essential element of the Buddhas teachings. This 
truth has been taught by the Buddha alone, it cannot be found outside 
the Buddhist teachings. Those who come into contact with Buddhism for 
the first time may be bewildered, even repelled by the truth of 
non-self. They wonder what the world would be without a self, without 
other people. Do we not live with and for other people? It is difficult 
to grasp the truth of non-self and its implications in daily life. What 
is called in conventional language a person or self is merely a 
temporary combination of physical phenomena and mental phenomena, which 
are depending on each other. They have been classified as five groups, 
in Pali khandhas: one group of all physical phenomena and four groups of
 mental phenomenafeelings, perceptions, mental activities and 
consciousness. The five khandhas are in a flux, in a constant process of
 formation and dissolution. There is nothing lasting, nothing eternal, 
nothing unchanging in life.

The khandhas which arise, fall away 
and do not return. Present khandhas are different from past khandhas but
 they are conditioned by past khandhas, and present khandhas condition 
in their turn future khandhas. We read in the Dialogues of the Buddha 
(I, number IX, Potthapada Sutta) that the Buddha explained to Citta 
about the three modes of personality: the past, the present and the 
future personality. They are different, but the past conditions the 
present and the present conditions the future. We read that the Buddha 
explained this by way of a simile:

 Just, Citta, as from a cow 
comes milk, and from the milk curds, and from the curds butter, and from
 the butter ghee, and from the ghee junket; but when it is milk it is 
not called curds, or butter, or ghee, or junket; and when it is curds it
 is not called by any of the other names.
 Just so, Citta, when any 
one of the three modes of personality is going on, it is not called by 
the name of the other. For these, Citta, are merely names, expressions, 
turns of speech, designations in common use in the world. And of these a
 Tathagata (one who has won the truth) makes use indeed, but is not led 
astray by them. 

We call by such or such a name what are actually
 the five khandhas. People have different characters, different 
personalities. In reality there is nothing static in what is called a 
person. The present personality is different from the past personality, 
but it has originated from the past personality. We read in the 
commentary to the Debates (to the Kathavatthu, Chapter I, the Person, 
33, 34):

 Given bodily and mental khandhas, it is customary to 
say such and such a name, a family. Thus, by this popular turn of 
speech, convention, expression, is meant: there is the personThe Buddhas
 have two kinds of discourse, the popular and the philosophical. Those 
relating to a being, a person, a deva (divine being), a brahma,are 
popular discourses, while those relating to impermanence, dukkha, 
non-self, the khandhas, the elements, the senses are discourses on 
ultimate meaning. A discourse on ultimate meaning is, as a rule, too 
severe to begin with; therefore the Buddhas teach at first by popular 
discourse, and then by way of discourse on ultimate meaning.
 The 
Enlightened One, best of speakers, spoke two kinds of truth, namely, the
 conventional truth and the ultimate truth, a third is not known.

Therein, a popular discourse is true in conventional sense. A discourse 
on ultimate realities is also true, and as such, characteristic of 
things as they are.

Before studying the Buddhist teachings we 
only knew conventional truth: the truth of the world populated by people
 and animals, the world of persons, of self. Through the Buddhist 
teachings we learn about the ultimate truth: the mental phenomena and 
physical phenomena which are impermanent.

The truth of non-self 
is ultimate truth. It is deep and hard to penetrate. It has been taught 
by way of similes in the Buddhist scriptures and in the commentaries. 
The great commentator Buddhaghosa, in his book the Path of Purification 
(Visuddhimagga), illustrates the truth of non-self with similes from 
Buddhist scriptures. The Path of Purification is a comprehensive 
exposition of the Buddhas teaching based on old commentaries and the 
tradition of the monks in Sri Lanka, written in the fifth century A.D. 
Buddhaghosa explains that when one thinks of a whole of mind and body, 
one clings to the concept of person, whereas when this whole is seen as 
different elements which are impermanent, one will lose the perception 
of self: We read in the Path of Purification (XVIII, 25, 26):

 As with the assembly of parts
 The word chariot is countenanced,
 So, when the khandhas are present,
 A being is said in common usage.

 Again, this has been said: Just as when a space is enclosed with timber
 and creepers and grass and clay, there comes to be the term house, so 
too, when a space is enclosed with bones and sinews and flesh and skin, 
there comes to be the term material form.

Further on (XVIII, 28) we read:

 So in many hundred suttas it is only mentality-materiality that is 
illustrated, not a being, not a person. Therefore, just as when the 
component parts such as axles, wheels, frame, poles, etc. are arranged 
in a certain way, there comes to be the mere term of common usage 
chariot, yet in the ultimate sense when each part is examined, there is 
no chariotand just as when the component parts of a house such as 
wattles, etc. are placed so that they enclose a space in a certain way, 
there comes to be the mere term of common usage house, yet in the 
ultimate sense there is no house,so too, when there are the five 
khandhas of clinging, there comes to be the mere term of common usage a 
being, a person, yet in the ultimate sense, when each component is 
examined, there is no being as a basis for the assumption I am or I; in 
the ultimate sense there is only mentality-materiality. The vision of 
one who sees in this way is called right vision.

If life can be considered as existing in just one moment, it will be less difficult to understand the truth of non-self. In the Maha-Niddesa
 (number 6, Decay) the Buddha explains that life is extremely short. In 
the ultimate sense it lasts only as long as one moment of consciousness.
 Each moment of consciousness which arises falls away completely, to be 
succeeded by the next moment which is different.

We read in the Path of Purification (XX, 72) a quotation from the Maha-Niddesa text about the khandhas which are impermanent:

 No store of broken states, no future stock; Those born balance like 
seeds on needle points. Break-up of states is fore-doomed at their 
birth; Those present decay, unmingled with those past. They come from 
nowhere, break up, nowhere go; Flash in and out, as lightning in the 
sky.

One is used to thinking of a self who coordinates all the 
different experiences through the senses and the mind, a self who can 
see, hear and think all at the same time, but in reality there can be 
only one moment of consciousness at a time which experiences one object.
 At one moment life is seeing, at another moment life is hearing and at 
another moment again life is thinking. Each moment of our life arises 
because of its own conditions, exists for an extremely short time and 
then falls away. Seeing arises dependant on eye-sense, on colour and on 
other factors. It exists just for a moment and then it is gone. Seeing 
arises and falls away very rapidly, but then there are other moments of 
seeing again and this causes us to erroneously believe that seeing 
lasts. The seeing of this moment, however, is different from seeing 
which is just past. Colour which appears at this moment is different 
from colour which is just past. How could there be a self who exerts 
control over seeing or any other reality? Realities such as kindness and
 anger arise because of their own conditions, there is no self who could
 exert control over them. We would like to speak kindly, but when there 
are conditions for anger, it arises. We may tell ourselves to keep 
silent, but, before we realize it, angry words have been spoken already.
 There was anger in the past and this has been accumulated. That is why 
it can arise at any time. Anger does not belong to a person, but it is a
 reality. We are used to identifying ourselves with realities such as 
anger, generosity, seeing or thinking, but it can be learnt that they 
are mental phenomena, arising because of their own conditions. We are 
used to identifying ourselves with our body, but the body consists of 
changing physical phenomena, arising because of their own conditions. 
Bodily phenomena are beyond control; ageing, sickness and death cannot 
be prevented. Realities come and go very rapidly, they can be compared 
with a flash of lightning. One cannot exercise any power over a flash of
 lightning, it is gone as soon as it has been noticed. Evenso, one 
cannot exert control over the mental and physical phenomena of ones 
life.
## How can awareness be developed while doing complicated things?
Extract from The World in the Buddhist Sense, letter 8

Dear Mr. G.,

You found it difficult to be aware while doing complicated things. I will quote from your letter:

emembering
 a combination of numbers in order to open a safe, there cannot be 
awareness. I find that a special effort is needed for awareness of nama 
and rupa. While I have to exert myself to do complicated things I have 
no energy left for awareness. When I, for exampl ytrregffddxccvvbbyes 
When I do things which can be performed automatically, like shaving, 
eating and walking, there can be awareness. But when I do complicated 
things like re, study a foreign language and I make an effort to 
memorize the words, I exclude all other things from my mind. At such 
moments I could not be aware.

you are very very naughty boy no 
yes you are.knnnn[]]kj4r/ Shaving, walking, eating, opening a safe, 
all these things we can do because there are conditions to be able to do
 them. If you had not been taught you would not know how to open a safe.
 Remembering something is nama, arising because of conditions. If we 
forget something, that also depends on conditions. The more we 
understand that realities are only nama and rupa, arising because of 
their own conditions, the less will there be hindrances to awareness. 
Realities such as visible object, hardness or feeling arise already 
because of their own conditions and you can begin to consider their 
different characteristics. You should not think of having to make an 
effort for sati because then there is still a notion of self who is 
aware. Sati can arise naturally in your daily life. When there is the 
study with awareness of one reality at a time there is a beginning of 
understanding. One should not try to hold on to realities in order to 
study them, because they do not stay.

We believe that realities 
are the way we experience them, but in fact we experience them in a 
distorted way. It seems to us that realities such as hardness or visible
 object stay because their arising and falling away has not been 
realized yet. Their impermanence cannot be realized so long as panna has
 not yet been developed to that stage. We know in theory that there is 
no self, but we still cling to the idea of self who is aware. We may 
take energy or effort for self. Effort or energy (viriya) is a cetasika,
 a mental factor which arises with many cittas, though not with each 
type. It arises with the citta and falls away together with it. When it 
accompanies kusala citta it is kusala and when it accompanies akusala 
citta it is akusala. There is no self who can exert control over effort,
 who can cause it to be kusala. When there is right awareness of a nama 
or rupa which appears through one of the six doors, there is already 
right effort accompanying the kusala citta. We do not have to try or to 
think of effort. When there is still wrong view, we may think that we 
cannot be aware while doing complicated things. We may think that at 
such moments awareness is more difficult than when we are walking or 
doing things which do not require much attention. In reality there is no
 difference. If one believes that there is a difference, one does not 
know what right awareness is. If there is less of a preconceived idea 
that in particular situations awareness is impossible, there can be 
awareness also while doing complicated things. We may be absorbed in 
what we are doing, but that doesnt matter. Being absorbed is a reality, 
it can be known as only a type of nama. Realities appear already because
 of their own conditions, and gradually we can learn to study their 
characteristics.

Misunderstandings are bound to arise as to what 
awareness really is and because of these misunderstandings people think 
that it is impossible to be aware in daily life. Someone wrote, for 
instance, that awareness is the same as keeping oneself under constant 
observation. We should observe ourselves in action, he said, and this 
can be done quite simply by asking oneself, What am I doing?. He thought
 that in this way we learn to be aware of what we are doing and that 
this constitutes awareness. The word awareness in conventional language 
has a meaning which is different from awareness, sati, of the Eightfold 
Path. When we ask ourselves, What am I doing?, what is the reality at 
that moment? There are many types of citta which think at such moments. 
If we do not realize that it is nama which thinks while we ask 
ourselves, What am I doing?, the wrong view of self will not be 
eradicated. There is only thinking about the self who is performing 
different actions. There is no sati of the Eightfold Path, there is no 
development of understanding of the different characteristics of nama 
and rupa. When we are reading and we answer the question, What am I 
doing?, with, I am reading, without development of understanding, we 
live only in the world of conventional truth. We will continue to be 
ignorant of the absolute truth, the truth about nama and rupa. When we 
are reading, is there not the nama which experiences visible object, is 
there not the rupa which is visible object, is there not the nama which 
thinks about the meaning of what is read, and should these realities not
 be known? It is the same when we are walking, talking or eating, if we 
only know I am walking, talking and eating, it is not at all helpful for
 the development of panna. There is still the wrong view of self. While 
we are walking, talking and eating there are nama and rupa appearing 
through the six doors, and right understanding can be developed of them.
 Some people believe that they have to slow down all their movements in 
order to be able to be aware. Is there desire for awareness? If one is 
not aware naturally in ones daily life panna cannot develop. The 
Satipatthana sutta (Middle Length Sayings I, no. 10) reminds us to be 
aware in our daily life, no matter what we are doing.

We read under the section of mindfulness of the body, regarding the postures:

 And again, monks, a monk, when he is walking, comprehends, I am 
walking; or when he is standing still, comprehends, I am standing still;
 or when he is sitting down, comprehends, I am sitting down; or when he 
is lying down, comprehends, I am lying down. So that however his body is
 disposed he comprehends that it is like that. Thus he fares along 
contemplating the body in the body internally, or he fares along 
contemplating the body in the body externally, or he fares along 
contemplating the body in the body internally and externally...

The commentary to this sutta, the Papancasudani explains the words, When he is going, a monk understands I am going as follows:

 In this matter of going, readily do dogs, jackals and the like, know 
when they move on that they are moving. But this instruction on the 
modes of deportment was not given concerning similar awareness, because 
awareness of that sort belonging to animals does not shed the belief in a
 living being, does not knock out the perception of a soul and neither 
becomes a subject of meditation nor the development of satipahana.

The
 commentary explains that there is no living being. There is going on 
account of the diffusion of the process of oscillation (motion) born of 
mental activity. There are only nama and rupa which arise because of 
conditions. When the monk is walking, standing, sitting or lying down, 
he contemplates the body in the body, he does not take the body for 
self. He is mindful of the realities which appear.

We read in the following section of the sutta, the section on clear comprehension:

 And again, monks, a monk when he is setting out or returning is one 
acting in a clearly conscious way; when he is looking in front or 
looking around... when he has bent in or stretched out (his arm)...when 
he is carrying his outer cloak, bowl and robe... when he is obeying the 
calls of nature... when he is walking, standing, sitting, asleep, awake,
 talking, silent, he is one acting in a clearly conscious way. Thus he 
fares along contemplating the body in the body 
internally...externally... internally and externally...

If one 
thinks of the body as a whole the arising and falling away of rupas 
cannot be realized and one will continue to cling to the idea of my 
body. During all ones activities there can be the development of right 
understanding, so that wrong view can be eradicated.

Sati is not:
 observing oneself in action. Sati arises with each beautiful (sobhana) 
citta and its function is being non-forgetful of what is wholesome. Sati
 is different from the cetasika sanna, remembrance or perception, which 
arises with each citta. Sanna recognizes or marks the object, so that it
 can be recognized later on. Sati of the Eightfold Path is mindful of 
the reality which presents itself at the present moment, and then right 
under-standing of it can be developed. We do not have to think of sati, 
it arises when there are conditions for it. When right understanding of a
 reality which presents itself is being developed, there is also sati 
which is mindful, non-forgetful, of that reality. For example, when the 
characteristic of hardness appears and it is realized as a kind of rupa,
 it is evident that there is sati. When we think, I am eating and we are
 not aware of different namas and rupas which appear, there is a concept
 of self who is eating. When right understanding is developed the self 
is broken up into different nama-elements and rupa-elements. In order 
that right under-standing can be developed there should be mindfulness 
of a characteristic of nama or rupa, not mindfulness without knowing 
anything.

If one thinks that sati means keeping oneself under 
constant observation, one is bound to believe that it is impossible to 
be aware while doing things which require special attention. One may be 
urged to make special efforts in order to create conditions for a great 
deal of sati. Any speculation about creating conditions for the arising 
of sati distracts from the study of the reality appearing right at this 
moment. It is thinking of the future instead of being aware of aversion 
now, seeing now, thinking now. There is clinging to an idea of self who 
can control awareness, and in that way there will not be detachment from
 the concept of self.

If we understand more clearly that our life
 consists of nama and rupa which arise because of conditions, we will be
 less absorbed in the idea of self while we do complicated things. Also 
at such moments there are only nama and rupa. We may believe that while 
we are talking there cannot be awareness, since we have to think about 
what we are saying. There is sound and can there not be awareness of it?
 It is citta, not self, which thinks about what we are going to say and 
which conditions sound. There can be awareness of realities in between 
thinking. I noticed that while I am writing the Chinese script (Kanji), 
it is possible to hear other people talking or to think of other things.
 This shows that there are many different types of cittas which succeed 
one another so rapidly that it seems that they occur all at the same 
time. Since there can be hearing or thinking in between the writing of 
Kanji, there can also be awareness in between.

You mentioned that
 you could not be aware while learning a foreign language. Learning a 
foreign language can teach us about reality. When we learn a foreign 
language such as Japanese we cannot in the beginning translate quickly. 
Later on we acquire skill and it seems that we do it automatically. When
 we hear a Japanese word we immediately know the meaning, it seems that 
hearing and knowing the meaning occur at the same time. However, we know
 that they are different moments of citta. Also when we hear words 
spoken in our own language there is hearing and then translating going 
on, we interpret the sounds so that we understand the meaning. The 
process of translation goes on very rapidly, it goes on the whole day. 
When there is seeing, visible object is experienced, but immediately we 
translate what we see, we interpret it, and then we discern people and 
things. If we consider the process of translation we can understand more
 clearly that seeing and hearing are different from thinking. The 
moments that we do not translate seeing and hearing can be studied. 
Thus, no matter whether you learn a foreign language or whether you are 
merely thinking after seeing or hearing, there is translating going on 
time and again. No matter what we do, there are nama and rupa, and 
sometimes sati can arise and be aware of them. We cannot control the 
cittas which arise. They arise and perform their own functions. So long 
as we believe that we can create conditions for the arising of sati, the
 right awareness will not arise. One may believe that there is sati when
 there is only ignorance of realities. Awareness can arise if there are 
conditions for it. The conditions are listening to the Dhamma and 
considering it. We may believe that we have listened and considered 
enough, but, when there are still misunderstandings about the Eightfold 
Path it is evident that our listening and considering have not been 
enough. We should not assume too soon that we studied enough. We have 
accumulated ignorance for aeons and therefore it will take aeons before 
it can be eradicated. This should not discourage us, but we should 
continue to listen, to read and to study, and we should consider 
thoroughly what we learnt. We should consider the Dhamma with regard to 
our own experiences in daily life.

Rahula, the Buddha's son, 
attained arahatship when he was only twenty years old. For him the 
conditions necessary for enlightenment were fulfilled: he associated 
with the right person, the Buddha, he listened to the Dhamma, he 
considered it and he developed the Eightfold Path. We read in the Middle
 Length Sayings (II, no. 62, Greater Discourse on an Exhortation to 
Rahula) that Rahula asked the Buddha how mindfulness of breathing, when 
it is developed and made much of, is of great fruit, of great advantage.
 The Buddha did not speak immediately about mindfulness of breathing, he
 first taught Rahula about the elements of solidity, cohesion, heat, 
motion and space. No matter whether these elements are internal or 
external, they should not be taken for self. The Buddha then said to 
Rahula:

 Develop the mind-development that is like the earth, 
Rahula. For, from developing the mind-development that is like the 
earth, Rahula, agreeable and disagreeable sensory impressions that have 
arisen, taking hold of your thought, will not persist.

In the 
same way the Buddha told Rahula to develop the mind-development that is 
like water, fire, wind and space (air). What are we doing when there are
 agreeable or disagreeable sense-impressions that take hold of us? Do we
 take them for self, or can we realize them as only elements? Rahula had
 to be mindful of all realities appearing through the six doors in order
 to see them as only elements.

Further on we read that the Buddha
 encouraged Rahula to the development of lovingkindness, compassion, 
sympathetic joy, equanimity, the contemplation of the foul and the 
perception of impermanence. It was only after the Buddha had taught all 
this to Rahula that he spoke about mindfulness of breathing. Rahula did 
not apply himself to this subject without knowing anything. While he 
applied himself to mindfulness of breathing he realized the true nature 
of all namas and rupas appearing through the six doors. He had 
accumulated great wisdom and therefore he was able to develop 
mindfulness of breathing so that it was of great fruit, of great 
advantage. The Buddha said that if it was developed in that way the 
final in-breaths and out-breaths too are known as they cease, they are 
not unknown. The Buddha taught Rahula about the eye, visible object and 
seeing-consciousness, about all realities which appear through the six 
doors. He taught Rahula until he attained arahatship. We read in the 
Kindred Sayings ( IV, Salayatana-vagga, Kindred Sayings on Sense, Third 
Fifty, Chapter II, paragraph 121, Rahula) that it occurred to the 
Buddha, while he was near Savatth, at the Jeta Grove, that Rahula was 
ripe for the attainment of arahatship. He wanted to give Rahula the last
 teachings and he said to him that they would go to Dark Wood. We read:

 Now at that time countless thousands of devas were following the 
Exalted One, thinking: Today the Exalted One will give the venerable 
Rahula the last teachings for the destruction of the asavas.
 So the 
Exalted One plunged into the depths of Dark Wood and sat down at the 
foot of a certain tree on the seat prepared for him. And the venerable 
Rahula, saluting the Exalted One, sat down also at one side. As he thus 
sat the Exalted One said to the venerable Rahula:
 Now what do you think, Rahula? Is the eye permanent or impermanent?
 Impermanent, lord.

 What is impermanent is that happiness or dukkha?
 Dukkha, lord.
 Now what is impermanent, woeful, by nature changeableis it fitting to regard that as This is mine. This am I. This is myself?
 Surely not, lord.

(The same is said about the other phenomena appearing through the sense-doors and through the mind-door.)

 Thus spoke the Exalted One. And the venerable Rahula was delighted with
 the words of the Exalted One and welcomed them. And when this 
instruction was given, the venerable Rahulas heart was freed from the 
asavas without grasping. And in those countless devas arose the pure and
 spotless eye of the Dhamma, so that they knew: Whatsoever is of a 
nature to arise, all that is of a nature to cease. 

When we read 
this sutta we may find it to be a repetition of so many suttas. We may 
read it countless times, but we may only have theoretical understanding 
of the truth. One day the truth may be realized but this depends on the 
degree of the development of panna. Is the eye permanent or impermanent?
 Is what is impermanent happiness or dukkha? Should we take it for self?
 Are the other realities permanent or impermanent? The Buddha spoke 
about all the realities which appear now. If we do not yet have a keen 
understanding of seeing and visible object which appear now, at this 
moment, if we cannot yet distinguish between the different 
characteristics of nama and of rupa which appear now, their arising and 
falling away cannot be realized. When the Buddha asked Rahula about the 
true nature of realities, would Rahula only have been thinking about 
nama and rupa, or did he at that moment realize their true nature? We 
know the answer. Rahula was mindful of realities appearing through the 
six doors, and thus his wisdom could be fully developed. Otherwise he 
could not have attained arahatship.
## What is nibbana (nirvana)?
The third noble Truth, the cessation of suffering, is nibbana. The 
Buddha experienced at his enlightenment nibbana. It is difficult to 
understand what nibbana, is. Nibbana (more popularly known in its 
Sanskrit form of nirvana) is not a place such as heaven or a paradise 
where one enjoys eternal bliss. There are heavenly planes, according to 
the Buddhist teachings, where one can be reborn as a result of a good 
deed, but existence in such planes is not forever. After ones lifespan 
in such a plane is ended there will be rebirth in other planes, and thus
 there is no end to suffering. Nibbana is only an object of speculation 
so long as it has not been realized. It can be realized when there is 
full understanding of all phenomena of life which arise because of their
 own conditions and then fall away. The conditioned phenomena of life 
are, because of their impermanence, unsatisfactory or suffering. Nibbana
 is the unconditioned reality, it does not arise and fall away and 
therefore it is not suffering, it is the end of suffering. Nibbana is 
real, it is a reality which can be experienced, but we cannot grasp what
 an unconditioned reality is when we have not realized the truth of 
conditioned realities. Nibbana is not a God, it is not a person or a 
self. Since negative terms are used to express what nibbana is, such as 
the end of rebirth, it may be felt that Buddhism propagates a negative 
attitude towards life. However, this is not the case. It has to be 
understood that rebirth is suffering and that nibbana is the end of 
suffering. Nibbana is freedom from all defilements, and since 
defilements are the cause of all unhappiness nibbana should be called 
the highest goal. We read in the Kindred Sayings (IV, Kindred Sayings on
 Sense, Part IV, Chapter 38, 1, Nibbana) that the wanderer 
Rose-apple-eater came to see the Buddhas disciple Sariputta and asked 
him what nibbana was. Sariputta answered:

 The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of illusion, friend, is called nibbana.

Extinction
 and freedom from desire are meanings of the word nibbana. Nibbana means
 the end of clinging to existence and thus it is deliverance from all 
future birth, old age, sickness and death, from all suffering which is 
inherent in the conditioned realities of life. The Buddha experienced at
 his enlightenment the unconditioned reality which is nibbana. His 
passing away was the absolute extinguishment of conditions for the 
continuation of the life process. When the Buddha was still alive people
 asked him what would happen to him after his passing away. He explained
 that this belongs to the questions which cannot be answered, questions 
which are merely speculative and do not lead to the goal. The Buddhas 
passing away cannot be called the annihilation of life, and there cannot
 be rebirth for him in another plane, either. If there would be rebirth 
he would not have reached the end of all suffering.
## Many religions teach about heaven and hell. In what respect are the Buddhist teachings different?
Many religions teach about heaven and hell. In what respect are the 
Buddhist teachings different? Do we just have to believe in heaven and 
hell? Through the Buddhist teachings we learn to study realities, to 
study cause and effect in life. Each cause brings about its appropriate 
result. People perform good and bad deeds and these deeds bring 
different results; they can cause births in different planes of 
existence. A plane of existence is the place where one is born. Birth in
 a woeful plane is the result of a bad deed and birth in a happy plane 
is the result of a good deed. Since the deeds of beings are of many 
different degrees of kusala and akusala, the results are of many 
different degrees as well. There are different woeful planes and 
different happy planes of existence.

The animal world is a woeful
 plane. We can see how animals devour one another and we find that 
nature is cruel. The animal world is not the only woeful plane. There 
are different hell planes. The akusala vipaka in hell is more intense 
than the sufferings which can be experienced in the human plane. The 
descriptions of hells in the Buddhist teachings are not merely 
allegories; the experience of unpleasant things through eyes, ears, 
nose, tongue and bodysense is akusala vipaka and akusala vipaka is 
reality. Life in a hell plane is not permanent; when ones lifespan in a 
hell plane is over there can be rebirth in another plane.

Apart 
from the animal plane and the hell planes, there are other woeful 
planes. Birth in the plane of petas (ghosts) is the result of akusala 
kamma, conditioned by lobha. Beings in that plane have a deformed figure
 and they are always hungry and thirsty. Furthermore, there is the plane
 of asuras (demons). The objects which are experienced in the asura 
plane are not as enjoyable as the objects which can be experienced in 
the human plane. There are four classes of woeful planes in all.

Birth
 as a human being is a happy rebirth. In the human plane there is 
opportunity for the development of kusala. One can study Dhamma and 
learn to develop the way leading to the end of defilements, to the end 
of birth and death. Birth in the human plane is kusala vipaka, but 
during ones lifespan in this plane there are both kusala vipaka and 
akusala vipaka. Each person experiences different results in life: there
 is gain and loss, honour and dishonour, praise and blame, happiness and
 misery. Each person is born into the family which is the right 
condition for him to experience the results of his deeds. It is due to 
ones kamma that one experiences pleasant and unpleasant things through 
eyes, ears, nose, tongue and bodysense.

Other happy planes, apart
 from the human plane, are the heavenly planes. In the heavenly planes 
there is more kusala vipaka than in the human plane and less akusala 
vipaka. There are several heavenly planes and although life in a 
heavenly plane lasts a very long time, it is not permanent. The woeful 
planes, the human plane and the six heavenly planes which are deva 
planes, are sensuous planes of existence. Sensuous planes of existence 
are planes where there is seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, the 
experience of tangible object through the bodysense and other kamavacara
 cittas (cittas which are of the sensuous plane of consciousness). There
 are eleven classes of sensuous planes of existence in all.

Those
 who see the disadvantages of sense-impressions may cultivate jhana; 
they can be reborn in higher heavenly planes which are not sensuous 
planes. Those who attain rupa-jhana can be reborn in rupa-brahma-planes 
where there are less sense-impressions. There are sixteen rupa-brahma 
planes in all. One of them is the asanna-satta plane where there is only
 rupa, not nama. Those who have attained the highest stage of rupa-jhana
 and who wish to have no consciousness at all, can be reborn without 
citta; for them there is only a body. These beings have seen the 
disadvantages of consciousness; even happiness is a disadvantage, since 
it does not last.

Those who see the disadvantages of rupa 
cultivate arupa-jhana. If they attain arupa-jhana they can be reborn in 
arupa-brahma planes where there is no rupa. There are four classes of 
arupa-brahma planes. Beings born in these planes have only nama, not 
rupa. One may wonder how there can be beings which only have rupa or 
beings which only have nama. When right understanding of nama and rupa 
has been developed realities will be seen as only elements which arise 
because of conditions, not a being, not a person, no self. Then there 
will be no doubt that, under the appropriate conditions, there can be 
rupa without nama and nama without rupa. 
## How can the Buddha's teachings be proved?
Extract from Abhidhamma in Daily Life, chapter 17

In
 being aware of nama and rupa which appear, such as seeing, visible 
object, feeling or thinking, we can prove to ourselves the truth of the 
Buddhas teachings; we can prove that the objects experienced through the
 six doors are impermanent and non-self. The truth will not be known if 
one follows other people blindly or if one speculates about the truth. 
We read in the Kindred Sayings (IV, Salayatana-vagga, Third Fifty, 
chapter V, 152, Is there a method?) that the Buddha said:

 Is 
there, monks, any method, by following which a monk, apart from belief, 
apart from inclination, apart from hearsay, apart from argument as to 
method, apart from reflection on reasons, apart from delight in 
speculation, could affirm insight thus: Ended is birth, lived is the 
righteous life, done is the task, for life in these conditions there is 
no hereafter?
 For us, lord, things have their root in the Exalted 
One Well indeed were it if the meaning of this that has been spoken were
 to manifest itself in the Exalted One. Hearing it from him the monks 
will remember it.
 There is indeed a method, monks, by following which a monk could affirm insight And what is that method?

 Herein, monks, a monk, seeing an object with the eye, either recognizes
 within him the existence of lust, aversion and ignorance, thus: I have 
lust, aversion and ignorance, or recognizes the non-existence of these 
qualities within him, thus: I have not lust, aversion and ignorance. Now
 as to that recognition of their existence or non-existence within him, 
are these conditions, I ask, to be understood by belief, or by 
inclination, or hearsay, or argument as to method, or reflection on 
reasons, or delight in speculation? Surely not, lord.
 Are these states to be understood by seeing them with the eye of wisdom?
 Surely, lord.

 Then, monks, this is the method by following which, apart from belief a
 monk could affirm insight thus: Ended is birth for life in these 
conditions there is no hereafter.

The same is said with regard to the doors of the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body and the mind.

When
 we study the Abhidhamma we should keep in mind the purpose of the 
Buddhas teachings: the eradication of defilements through the wisdom 
which realizes the phenomena appearing through the six doors as they 
are. Through this method there will be an end to the cycle of birth and 
death. We should remember that the Abhidhamma is not a theoretical 
textbook but an exposition of realities appearing in daily life. We 
learn about nama and rupa; we learn about cittas which each have their 
own function in the sense-door process and in the mind-door process. 
There are sense-door processes and mind-door processes time and again, 
and objects are experienced by cittas arising in these processes. If 
there is awareness of characteristics of nama and rupa when they appear,
 the panna is developed which can eradicate defilements. This kind of 
wisdom is deeper than any kind of theoretical knowledge. 
## What can we do to overcome these accumulated tendencies to akusala (unwholesomeness)?
From Cambodia Lectures chapter 2.

Sujin : At the attainment of 
Buddhahood, the Buddha realized the truth of Dhamma by his wisdom which 
eradicated defilements completely. His teaching is different from all 
other teachings and methods. The highest degree of wisdom taught by 
other religions and philosophies is only the degree which can 
temporarily subdue defilements. Defilements can only be completely 
eradicated by panna, wisdom, developed through satipatthana, which is 
actually the development of right understanding of the eightfold Path. 
Only the Buddha has taught this Path, there is no other way leading to 
the eradication of defilements.

Bhikkhu: I can develop this Path 
sometimes, but I want to develop it thoroughly and reach the goal. I do 
not know how many lives it will take to reach the goal. I have listened 
to lectures about vipassan, the development of insight, and I have heard
 that through insight clinging and the other defilements can be 
eradicated. The eradication of defilements is most important, but it is 
extremely difficult, not only for laypeople but also for bhikkhus.

S.
 : The venerable bhikkhu said that the eradication of defilements is 
difficult, no matter it concerns bhikkhus or laypeople. It is only panna
 which can eradicate defilements. If panna does not arise it is 
impossible to eradicate them.

Through the accumulation of wisdom 
together with all the other perfections the Bodhisatta could in his last
 life, at the attainment of enlightenment, become an omniscient Buddha. 
Therefore, everyone who is sincerely interested in the Dhamma and who is
 motivated to study it, should realize that the development of panna is 
of the highest benefit. Without panna it is impossible to eradicate 
defilements, and if someone who does not develop panna believes that he 
can eradicate them, he is utterly deluded. Each person has accumulated 
many defilements during countless lives, they are accumulated from the 
past on to this present life, and in this life from the moment of birth 
until now. However, we should not be discouraged because of this. If we 
listen to the Dhamma and there is more understanding of it, we can very 
gradually learn to investigate the characteristics of the realities 
which appear. This is the way leading to the realization of the truth 
that dhamma is dhamma, not I, mine or self.

When someone begins 
to listen to the Dhamma and sees that the Dhamma is a most difficult 
subject, he should not become disheartened. If people, instead of being 
discouraged, begin to develop panna, they will see that what at first 
seemed most complicated gradually becomes clearer. The development of 
right understanding in daily life can become ones habitual inclination 
and eventually one will be able to fully develop it.

B. : The 
listeners say that while they are listening to the Dhamma their minds 
are occupied with the Dhamma, and there is understanding of it. However,
 when they have finished listening they are distracted, they are 
absorbed in other things. What should they do in order to cause the 
citta to be firm and steady with regard to what is wholesome, to be 
intent on the Dhamma all the time?

S. : This is not possible all 
the time. However, the citta can gradually become more intent on the 
Dhamma, depending on ones understanding and confidence. The person who 
has understanding of the Dhamma will not be forgetful of what he has 
heard, he will ponder over it and consider it. If he has free time he 
may be inclined to read the scriptures. When he wakes up in the morning 
he may still think of the Dhamma he has heard. He may, for example, 
remember what he heard about rpas of the body. When he touches hardness 
he can remember that tangible object is not self, not a being, not a 
person. No matter whether we are asleep or awake, sit, lie down, stand 
or walk, there is the body; the body is right at hand. There are rupas 
of the body appearing whenever we touch what is hard or soft. If someone
 has firm remembrance of the Dhamma he has heard, and if he has 
accumulated confidence and the other spiritual faculties, indriyas, 
there are the right conditions for the arising of mindfulness. Sati can 
be directly aware of the characteristics of realities which are 
appearing at the present moment. Then he understands that the dhammas, 
the realities which are appearing, are not abstract categories. Citta, 
cetasika and rupa, all realities which are explained in the Tipitaka, 
are appearing now. The truth of Dhamma pertains to this very moment. As 
panna develops there can be awareness and investigation of the 
characteristics of realities and in this way they will be seen more 
clearly. However, if people cling to panna it cannot be developed. When 
we have listened to the Dhamma we acquire more understanding of it, and 
then, in accordance with what we have learnt about realities, sati can 
be aware of the characteristics of realities which appear. Some people 
have a great deal of understanding whereas others do not have much 
understanding, depending on the extent they have listened to the Dhamma 
and considered it. Listening to the Dhamma, intellectual understanding 
of it and pondering over it, these are conditions which support the 
arising of sati, and in this way the truth about realities can be 
understood more clearly. However, we should not be negligent with regard
 to the development of understanding.

We should remember that the
 Buddha in countless former lives as a Bodhisatta had to accumulate the 
perfections. In his last life during which he attained enlightenment, he
 was a human being, just like all of us who are sitting here. He was 
seeing visible object through the eyes, hearing sound through the ears 
and thinking of different things; he was not all the time thinking of 
the Dhamma. However, he needed to know the true nature of seeing while 
he was seeing, he needed to know the true nature of hearing while he was
 hearing. He needed to know these phenomena as they are because they are
 realities. After seeing and hearing there are like and dislike of what 
has been seen and heard, and these are also realities which should be 
known as they are.

The Buddha knew that it is extremely difficult
 to know the true nature of phenomena such as seeing or hearing, which 
are realities occurring time and again, in daily life. We could reduce 
our life to just one moment, because life actually occurs during one 
moment of citta which experiences an object and is then gone. However, 
if one is not a Bodhisatta one is absorbed in thinking for a long time 
about what appears just for a moment through the eyes, the ears, the 
nose, the tongue, the bodysense or the mind. The Bodhisatta was 
altogether different from us who are time and again infatuated with what
 we experience. Since he knew that the way leading to enlightenment was 
extremely difficult, he accumulated patience, energy and the other 
perfections, which were necessary conditions to attain Buddhahood. He 
had endless endurance and he did not become disheartened while he 
accumulated the perfections with the purpose to penetrate the truth of 
realities and to be able to teach other beings, so that they also could 
become free from dukkha just like he himself.

Everybody here has 
the opportunity to listen to the Dhamma which the Buddha realized at the
 attainment of enlightenment and which he taught to others as well. You 
do not need to accumulate the perfections to the extent the Buddha 
accumulated them for the attainment of Buddhahood, but you can listen to
 the Dhamma and practise the way the Buddha has shown us.

Listening
 to the Dhamma, listening intently, is an essential condition for the 
arising of panna, there is no other method to develop panna. If people 
are listening only superficially they are not really listening to the 
Dhamma. They may call listening what is not really listening, because 
what they hear goes in at one ear and out at the other; there is no 
understanding of what they heard. Listening to the Dhamma is actually 
paying careful attention to what one hears and pondering over it with 
understanding. It is most important to remember that listening also 
means applying what one hears. It is not enough to have only theoretical
 understanding of what one hears, but one should also practise what the 
Buddha taught.

B. : The venerable bhikkhu says that he has 
listened already but that he now wants to really practise the Dhamma. 
However, he has many different tasks to accomplish with regard to the 
Order of monks, and because of his work his citta is distracted. He has 
no opportunity to sit quietly, alone. He has listened to the Dhamma and 
he has understood what he has heard, but he has no leisure time. He 
wonders whether there is only one way of practice or more than one, 
depending on ones way of life. A monk has a way of life which is 
different from the life of laypeople. He understands that laypeople can 
practise the Dhamma, but he, as a bhikkhu, has many tasks to do which 
make it difficult to practise. Since he himself is still young he has a 
lot of work to do. When he is older he will have more leisure time for 
the practice.

S. : The venerable bhikkhu said that he had 
listened to the Dhamma already, but, our listening is never enough. Even
 the arahats in the Buddhas time continued to listen to the Dhamma. The 
Buddha taught the Dhamma for fortyfive years with the purpose to help 
people to understand the Truth. We may have listened for a long time, 
but if we do not come to understand the characteristics of the realities
 which are appearing, we have not listened long enough yet. It would be 
better, instead of wanting to practise, to begin to understand the 
characteristics of the realities appearing at this very moment. We may 
wish to have no more defilements, but can defilements be eradicated at 
all if we do not listen to the Dhamma and understand as they are the 
characteristics of the realities which are appearing?

As regards 
the venerable bhikkhus remark about his lack of free time for the 
practice, not only monks but also laymen have many tasks to fulfill; 
also many laymen complain that they have no leisure time for the 
practice. However, the practice of the Dhamma does not depend on the 
amount of free time one has. Just now, while we are sitting here, there 
are realities appearing. There are seeing and hearing, and these are 
real. Also when we are doing our work there are realities appearing. We 
cannot select a particular time for the understanding of this or that 
reality. It is necessary to develop panna which understands the 
realities which are appearing in daily life, until there is complete 
understanding of them. In this way ignorance, doubt and wrong view of 
self can be eradicated. 
## What is the process of cittas which arise and perform each their own function while they experience a sense object?
Extract from Abhidhamma in Daily Life, chapter 15

An object which
 impinges on one of the senses can be visible object, sound, odour, 
flavour or tangible object. Each of these objects is rupa. They arise 
and fall away, but they do not fall away as rapidly as nama. As we have 
seen (in chapter 12), rupa lasts as long as seventeen moments of citta. 
When a sense object which is rupa impinges on one of the senses, a 
process of cittas occurs which arise in a particular order and perform 
each their own function while they experience that sense object. The 
first citta of that process, the panca-dvaravajjana-citta, 
five-door-adverting-consciousness, does not arise immediately. First 
there have to be bhavanga-cittas and these are: atita-bhavanga, past 
bhavanga, bhavanga-calana, vibrating bhavanga, and bhavangupaccheda, 
arrest-bhavanga or last bhavanga before the current of bhavanga-cittas 
is arrested. These bhavanga-cittas do not experience the rupa which 
impinges on one of the senses. The panca-dvaravajjana-citta, which is a 
kiriyacitta, adverts to the object and is then succeeded by one of the 
dvi-panca-vinnanas (seeing-consciousness, hearing-consciousness, etc.) 
which is vipaka, the result of a good deed or a bad deed. There is, 
however, not only one moment of vipaka in a process, but several 
moments. The dvi-panca-vinnana is succeeded by sampaticchana-citta 
(receiving-consciousness) which is vipaka and this citta is succeeded by
 santirana-citta (investigating-consciousness) which is also vipaka. The
 santirana-citta is succeeded by the votthapana-citta 
(determining-consciousness) which is kiriyacitta. This citta is 
succeeded by seven javana-cittas which are, in the case of non-arahats, 
akusala cittas or kusala cittas. All cittas, starting with the 
panca-dvaravajjana-citta, experience the object which impinges on one of
 the senses. Counting from the atita-bhavanga, fifteen moments of citta 
have elapsed when the seventh javana-citta has fallen away. If the rupa 
which has impinged on one of the senses arose at the same time as the 
atita-bhavanga, that rupa can survive two more moments of citta, since 
the duration of rupa equals seventeen moments of citta. Thus, after the 
javana-cittas there can be two more moments of citta which directly 
experience the object. These cittas, which are vipakacittas, are 
tadarammana-cittas or tadalambana-cittas. They perform the function of 
tadarammana or tadalambana, which is translated as registering or 
retention. Tadarammana literally means that object; the citta hangs on 
to that object. When the tadarammana-cittas have fallen away the 
sense-door process has run its full course. There is, however, not 
always a complete sense-door process. When the rupa which impinges on 
one of the senses has arisen before the atita-bhavanga, the process 
cannot run its full course. Since rupa does not last longer than 
seventeen moments of citta, it falls away before the tadarammana-cittas 
could arise. Thus, in that case there are no tadarammana-cittas.

Only
 in the sensuous plane of existence kamma can, after kamavacara 
javana-cittas (of the sense-sphere), produce the vipakacittas which are 
the tadarammana-cittas, hanging on to the sense object. For those who 
are born in rupa-brahma-planes where there are less conditions for 
sense-impressions, and for those who are born in arupa-brahma-planes 
where there are no sense-impressions, there are no tadarammana-cittas.

Summarizing
 the cittas which succeed one another when a rupa impinges on one of the
 senses and becomes the object of cittas of a sense-door process which 
runs its full course:

 1. Atita-bhavanga (past bhavanga)
 2. Bhavanga-calana (vibrating bhavanga)
 3. Bhavangupaccheda (arrest-bhavanga)
 4. Panca-dvaravajjana-citta (five-door-adverting- consciousness)
 5. Dvi-panca-vinnana (the five pairs of seeing- consciousness, etc.)
 6. Sampaticchana-citta (receiving-consciousness)
 7. Santirana-citta (investigating-consciousness)
 8. Votthapana-citta (determining-consciousness)
 9. Javana-cittas, kusala cittas or akusala cittas (in the case of Non-arahats), "running through" the object
 10. Javana-cittas
 11. Javana-cittas
 12. Javana-cittas
 13. Javana-cittas
 14. Javana-cittas
 15. Javana-cittas
 16. 1 Tadarammana-citta (registering-consciousness)
 17. 1 Tadarammana-citta (registering-consciousness)
## Who should be our guide?
Extract from Cambodia Lectures

S. : There is no doubt that the 
Dhamma is our guide and therefore people should not be attached to 
teachers. It is very difficult to thoroughly and completely understand 
the Tipitaka, both as to the letter and the meaning, but we are able to 
acquire more understanding of it by listening to any person who can 
explain the truth of Dhamma. However, we should not accept what is not 
in conformity with realities. We should not cling to persons, we should 
not believe in persons more than in the Dhamma itself. We should really 
have confidence in the Dhamma the Buddha assigned as his successor, as 
our guide.

Everything which occurs does so because of the 
appropriate conditions. Nobody knows in the case of a particular person 
his accumulated conditions for such or such aspect of the Dhamma or for 
the performing of such or such task in the field of Buddhism. May 
everyone who has the desire to study the Dhamma help to make known the 
Dhamma in accordance with his own ability. If someone helps explaining 
the Dhamma, it is not necessary that there are many people who come to 
listen to him or her. People who have knowledge and understanding of the
 Dhamma can, each in their own way, help others who do not know the 
Dhamma to acquire understanding of it. There is no need to think, I 
succeed this person, or, That person succeeds me. Different people can 
each perform a task in the field of Dhamma, in accordance with the 
understanding and capability they have accumulated.

The way to 
make known the Dhamma is to first study it oneself, in order to have 
right understanding. It is wrong to expect others to study the Dhamma 
and not to study it oneself. Someone may say that Buddhism is most 
beneficial, that it gives solutions to the problems in our life and in 
society, but does he really study the Dhamma himself? The person who 
wants to study Buddhism should be quite sure when he will do so. 
Otherwise he will keep on thinking about the study he will do in the 
future, instead of actually studying the Dhamma. When a person is sure 
when he will study the Dhamma he should also know what exactly he will 
study and where, in which place, he will study. These are things people 
should investigate in the right way; they should not neglect studying 
and gaining understanding of the Dhamma themselves, they should not 
merely repeat what they have heard from others.

There is only one
 way which is the right way: everyone should be his own refuge by 
studying the Dhamma with the purpose to acquire more understanding of 
it. Everyone who studies the Dhamma and has right understanding of it, 
contributes to the propagation of the Dhamma, both with regard to 
himself and others. When people do not have right understanding of the 
Dhamma themselves they cannot propagate it. 
## Who is the maker of this human being?
From the Kindred Sayings 1, Ch v, 10

 At Savatthi, Sister Vajira,
 rising early plunged into the depths of Dark Wood, and seated herself 
at the foot of a certain tree for noonday rest. Then Mara the evil one, 
desirous to arouse fear, wavering, and dread in her, desirous of making 
her desist from being alone, went up to her, and addressed her in 
verse:-

 By whom was wrought this being? Where is he
 Who makes him? Whence doth a being rise?
 Where doth the being cease and pass away?

 Then Sister Vajira thought: Who now is this, human or non-human, that 
speaketh verse? Sure it is Mara the evil one that speaketh verse, 
desirous of arousing in me fear, wavering, and dread, desirous of making
 me desist from being alone. And the Sister, knowing it was Mara, 
replied in verse:-

 Being! Why dost thou harp upon that word?
 Mong false opinions, Mara, hast thou strayed.
 Mere bundle of conditioned factors, this!
 No being can be here discerned to be.
 For just as, when the parts are rightly set,
 The word chariot ariseth [in our minds],
 So doth our usage covenant to say:
 A being when the aggregates are there.

 Nay, it is simply ill that rises, ill
 That doth persist, and ill that wanes away.
 Nought beside ill it is that comes to pass,
 Nought else but ill it is doth cease to be.
 Then Mara the evil one thought: Sister Vajira knows me, and sad and sorrowful he vanished there and then.
## The Missing Missis: Whatever happened to Mrs Buddha and her son?
(From the Tipitaka) Princess Yasodhara married the future Buddha 
(Bodhisatta), Gotama at the age of 16. On the day of the birth of their 
son Rahula the Bodhisatta renounced the world to find the path to 
enlightenment.

Princess Yashodhara and Rahula were eventually 
ordained into the Buddhist Order where they both developed insight and 
attained arahantship. In the Apadana the princess declares her 
attainment (translation not yet published). In the Psalms of the 
Brethren, Rahula 294-298, Rahula declares his attainment: (AW)

Reborn
 in this Buddha-age through our Bodhisat, as the son of Princess 
Yasodhara, he was reared with a great retinue of nobles. The 
circumstances of his entering the Order are recorded in the Khandhaka. 
And he, his knowledge ripened by gracious words in many Sutta passages, 
conjured up insight, and so won arahantship. Thereupon, reflecting on 
his victory, he confessed anna:

 Twice blest of fortune am I whom my friends
 Call 'Lucky Rahula.' for I am both
 Child of the Buddha and a Seer of truths;
 Yea, and intoxicants are purged from me;
 Yea, and there's no more coming back to be.
 Ar'hant am I, worthy of men's offerings;
 'Thrice skilled' my ken is of ambrosial things.
 Blinded are beings by their sense-desires,
 Spread o'er them like a net; covered are they
 By cloack of craving; by their heedless ways
 Caught as a fish in mouth of funnel-net,
 But I, that call of sense abandoning,
 Have cut and snapt the bonds of devil's lure.
 Craving with craving's root abolishing;
 Cool am I now; extinct is fever's fire.
## Who destroys Buddhism?
Buddhists destroy Buddhism.-AlanWeller

From the Kindred Sayings xvi, 12

 Thus have I heard: The Exalted One was once staying at Savatthi, at Jeta Grove, in the Anathapindika Park.
 Now the venerable Maha-Kassapa went into his presence, saluted him and sat down beside him. So seated, the venerable Maha-Kassapa
 said this to the Exalted One: 'What now, Lord, are the conditions, what
 is the cause that formerly there were both fewer precepts and more 
brethren were established as Arahants ? What, lord, are the conditions, 
what is the cause that now-a-days there are more precepts and fewer 
brethren are established as Arahants?'
 'It happens thus, Kassapa. 
When members decrease, and the true doctrine disappears, there are then 
more precepts, and few brethren are established as Arahants. There is no
 disappearing of the true doctrine, Kassapa, till a counterfeit doctrine
 arises in the world; but when a counterfeit doctrine does arise, then 
there is a disappearance of the true doctrine. Just as there is no 
disappearing of gold so long as there is no counterfeit gold arisen in 
the world. So it is with the true doctrine.
 ' The earth-element, 
Kassapa, does not make the true doctrine disappear, nor does the 
water-element, nor the heat-element, nor the air-element. But here in 
the Order itself futile men arise, and it is they who make the true 
doctrine disappear.
 'Take the sinking of a ship, Kassapa, by 
overlading: it is not thus that the true doctrine disappears. There are 
five lowering things that conduce to the obscuration and disappearance 
of the true doctrine. Which five?
 'It is when brethren and sisters, 
laymen and laywomen live in irreverence and are unruly toward the 
Teacher, live in irreverence and are unruly toward the training, live in
 irreverence and are unruly toward concentrative study.
 'But when 
they live in reverence and docility toward these Five, then do these 
five things conduce to the maintenance, the clarity, the presence of the
 true doctrine.
## What sort of person is a better man than a good man?
From the Designation of Human Types, chapter 4

 What sort of person is a better man than a good man?

 Here a certain person, while he himself refrains from the destruction 
of life, incites others to refrain, himself refrains from taking things 
not given, incites others to refrain, himself refrains from misbehaviour
 in sensual pleasures, incites others to refrain, himself refrains from 
indulging in the enjoyment of spirituous, fermented liquors and 
intoxicants, incites others to refrain. Such is the person who is said 
to be a better man than a good man.
## I've heard it said that Abhidhamma is not necessary. After all the Buddha taught only suffering and the end of suffering?
(Source Robert Kirkpatrick)

Yes, but how to get to the end of suffering. The Abhidhamma is the map for this. Here's an analogy.

Say
 we are sick and only one medicine can cure us. We hear that the 
medicine comes from the forest, so we go to the forest and search and 
search. We find many exotic and rare herbs etc. We try different 
mixtures and submit to different healing regimes. However although much 
of this seems to help eventually we realise it is only suppressing the 
symptoms. None of it is actually curing the disease. Then a great doctor
 explains that the cure is right in front of us. The leaves of the most 
common trees when chewed regularly gradually eradicates the disease 
until it finally disappears.

In the same way the Abhidhamma helps
 us to see that all the common realities of our daily life-seeing, 
hearing, attachment etc.-when experienced with understanding are the 
very things which will liberate us. If we don't have the Abhidhamma its 
very easy to go away from the path. 
## There appear to be two heavyweights at understanding the world-buddhism and physics. What do they have in common and where do they differ?
# What they have in common
They are both reproducible. Buddhism 
concerns the development of understanding of reality which appears now 
through six doorways. By developing this understanding characteristics 
of reality will show up as they are and as written in the texts.  
Similarly physics experiments can be reproduced to verify measurement.

# Where do they differ
In
 Buddhism the object of the understanding is a reality. In physics the 
object of understanding is a concept. For example temperature. The 
physicist understands temperature as the average kinetic energy of 
particles. This is THINKING about reality. However temperature has a 
characteristic which can be directly experienced through the body-sense.
 We do not have to call it anything. If awareness is developed when hot 
or cold appear then understanding of the characteristic of this reality 
can be known. This understanding has a REALITY as its object. AW
