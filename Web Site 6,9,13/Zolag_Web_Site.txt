About
====

*GREETINGS* and a *BIG WAVE* to *all SURFERS*. Zolag are publishers of Buddhist books
and articles. Currently we have several books in print and on this site thousands
of pages of books and articles for free download. We also have several unique books on various topics from the 'abhidhamma', `the theory of buddhism'. The aim of these books is to bridge the gap between theory and practice and help to give a precision to the  understanding of buddhism.

TIP: If you are a beginner and want to get to grips with the core of Buddhism quickly-there is a quarter page article link:real.html[here], and a short 5 page article link:UR/index.html[here]. Also under the book
section, link:books.html[Buddhism (and Abhidhamma) in Daily Life]. From the download section, The Buddha's Path.
