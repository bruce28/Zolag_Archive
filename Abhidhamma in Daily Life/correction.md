Dear friends,

6. The sixth class is Dhammårammaùa. It comprises all objects other than those included in the first five classes of objects. It includes all rúpas except the sense objects, all nåmas, namely citta and cetasika, the unconditioned dhamma which is nibbåna, and concepts. 

The five sense objects are experienced through their relevant sense-doors, and all other objects are experienced only through the mind-door. That is why they are included in dhammårammaùa.

When we read about the classification of objects we should remember that this is not theory. Objects are experienced all the time in daily life. When sense objects appear their characteristics can be investigated and in this way there can be a beginning of right understanding of their true nature as not a person, not a thing, but only a conditioned reality. It seems that visible object is there already for some time, but in reality it appears for an extremely short moment and then it is gone, never to return. There are many moments of thinking and usually this is about what is only a concept, not a reality. A concept is not real but thinking which thinks of concepts is a reality which is not self.
