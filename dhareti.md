S: As we read in the texts, dhamma stems from the verb dharati (caus. dhāreti - 'to bear')
meaning ('quality) that is to be borne'. It means dhātu.
It is that which bears a real nature or sabhava (dhammaṭṭhitatā ti sabhāvaṭṭhitatā)

From the Tīka to the Mūlapariyāya Sutta, MN 1, transl. by B.Bodhi:

" 'They bear their own characteristics': although there are no dhammas devoid of their own characteristics, this is still said for the purpose of showing that these are mere dhammas endowed with their specific natures (sabhāva) devoid of such attributions as that of a 'being' etc. Whereas such entities as self, beauty, pleasurableness, and permanence, etc, or nature (pakati), substance (dabba), soul (jūva), body, etc,which are mere misconstructions (parikappitaakaaramatta) due to craving and views, or such entities as 'sky-flowers', etc, which are mere expressions of conventional discourse (lokavohaaramatta), cannot be discovered as ultimately real actualities (saccikaṭṭhaparamatthato), these dhammas (i.e. those endowed with a specific nature(sabhāva)) can. These dhammas are discovered as ultimately real actualities.And though there is no real distinction (between these dhammas and their characteristics), still in order to facilitate understanding, the exposition makes a distinction as a mere metaphorical device (upacāramatta). Or else they are borne (dhārīyanti), they are discerned, known, according to their specific nature (sabhāva), thus they are dhammas."
