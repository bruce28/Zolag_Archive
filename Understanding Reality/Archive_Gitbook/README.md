Description

A short 5 page introduction to Buddhism.

Our thinking about reality is conditioned by many ideas we acquired through our 
education an through the culture in which we are rooted. 
If we want to understand what the Buddha taught we should not hold on to our
 own ideas about reality and we should be open-minded to his teaching. 
 Then we will notice that his teaching is completely different from our 
 ideas about reality. (extract)
