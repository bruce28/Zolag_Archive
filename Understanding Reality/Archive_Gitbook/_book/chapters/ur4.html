                        <h1 id="-n-mas-and-r-pas">﻿Nāmas and rūpas</h1>
<p>What we take for a person are in reality only different nāmas an
rūpas which arise and then fall away again. The nāma and rūpa in our
life are realities which can be directly experienced. They are real,
but they do not stay. They arise and then fall away immediately. We are
full of wrong ideas about reality, we believe that a self sees and
hears, that a self performs good deeds and bad deeds, the whole day
there is clinging to a self. Wrong view about reality cannot lead to
any good. So long as we believe in a self there cannot be any
eradication of attachment, aversion and ignorance and then we will
always be enslaved to the eight &quot;worldly conditions&quot; of gain and loss,
fame and obscurity, praise and blame, contentment and pain.</p>
<p>There is no self who experiences something. The seeing sees, the
hearing hears, the thinking thinks. What is the use of knowing this? It
is essential to know that not a self but different moments of
consciousness experience different objects. The can be only one moment
of consciousness at a time an it experiences one object. We may be
inclined to think that nāmas can last for a while. We may believe that
thinking, for example, can last form some time. In reality there are
many different moments of thinking and they think of only one object at
a time. Can we think of more than one thing at a time? This is
impossible. Seeing is a moment of consciousness and it experiences only
one object: the visible object. after seeing there can be thinking of
what we have seen or there can be hearing, but these moments cannot
arise at the same time. All these moments are different. We should know
nāma and rūpa as they appear one at a time through the six doors.
Ideas such as person, car or tree are not realities, they cannot be
directly experienced and thus they are not objets of which we should
develop insight.</p>
<p>The Buddha taught that only one nāma or rūpa can e known at a
time, when it presents itself through one of the six doors. We may
understand this in theory, but now we have to prove it through the
direct experience of realities. This is not easy, because we still
cling to our won view of reality. Still, we have to know the different
objects which present themselves one at a time through the different
doorways.</p>
<p>Once I was having lunch with &quot;Khun Sujin,&quot; my good friend in the
Dhamma, in a Chinese restaurant in Bangkok. I was served a duck&#39;s foot
and when I looked at it I had aversion. Khun Sujin said, &quot;Just taste
it, try it, without paying attention to the shape and form.&quot; I tasted
it without paying attention to the shape and form. The taste was good.
At that time I did not understand yet the full meaning of Khun Sujin&#39;s
lesson, but she wanted to show me that the experience through the eyes
is one thing, and the experience through the tongue the eyes is one
thing, and the experience through the tongue quite another thing and
thus another reality. We join all the different experiences together
into a &quot;whole&quot; and we think&quot; &quot;I am eating a duck&#39;s foot.&quot; Duck&#39;s foot
is not a reality. What are the realities?</p>
<ul>
<li>There is the experience of visible object,</li>
<li>there is visible object,</li>
<li>there is attention to shape and form, and this is different from
   seeing,</li>
<li>there is aversion,</li>
<li>there is tasting, the experience of flavour,</li>
<li>there is flavour,</li>
<li>there is thinking of the flavour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus we see that there are different mental phenomena, nāmas, and
physical phenomena, rūpas, and these can be known one at a time. We
can begin to develop right understanding of the realities of our life.
If we do not come to know nāmas and rūpas which appear one at a time,
we believe that a duck&#39;s foot, a person, a house or a car realities
which exist. However, these things are ideas, not ultimate realities
(paramattha dhammas). Namas and rūpas which can be experienced one at
a time are realities. Our life is nāmas and rūpas which arise and
fall away. When there is a clearer understanding of the realities which
can be directly experienced, one nāma or rūpa at a time, there will
be less confusion in our life and we will gradually learn that there is
no self.</p>
