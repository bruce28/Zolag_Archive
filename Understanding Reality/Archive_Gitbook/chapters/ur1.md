Introduction
=============

Can we find true happiness in life? There are moments of happiness in
our life but these do not last. Pleasant things we enjoy are
susceptible to change, they do not last. We do not really see the
impermanence of what is in ourselves and around ourselves, we always
cling to what is actually impermanent. The pleasant and unpleasant
events of our lives condition very much our feelings. We are slaves of
the vicissitudes of life. One day we are praised and then we are glad.
The next day we are treated unjustly and we are humiliated, and then we
are sad.  There are in our life. We read in the "Gradual Sayings" (Book
of Eights, Ch I, par. 6) that the Buddha spoke to the monks about the
eight worldly conditions which obsess the world. He spoke with regard
to those who have not attained enlightenment as follows:

   >  ...monks, gain comes to the unlearned common average folk, who
     reflect not thus:"This gain which has come is impermanent, painful
     and subject to change." They know it not as it really is. Loss
     come...fame...obscurity...blame...praise...contentment...
     pain...They reflect not that such are impermanent, painful and
     subject to change, nor do they know these conditions as they
     really are.  Gain, loss and so forth take possession of their
     minds and hold sway there.  they welcome the gain which has
     arisen; they rebel against obscurity.  They welcome the praise
     which has arisen; they rebel against blame.  They welcome the
     contentment which has arisen; they rebel against pain.  Thus given
     over to compliance and hostility, they are not freed from birth,
     old age, death, sorrows, lamentations, pains, miseries and
     tribulations. I say such folk are not free from ill.


We then read that for the "ariyan disciple," who has attained
enlightenment, the opposite is the case. We may wonder what the secret
is of the ariyan disciple.  He sees things as they really are and is
not enslaved to the worldly conditions.  Could we also become an ariyan
disciple? At this moment we are still "unlearned, common, average
folk." From the Buddha's teachings we learn that seeing realities as
they are can make us less enslaved to the worldly conditions.  Seeing
things as they are, that is true wisdom. Do we see realities as they are
or do we live in dreams and fantasies? In our life there are realities
and there are imaginations or ideas which we form up in our mind. We do
not even know the difference between reality and imagination. However,
in order to see things as they really are we must know the difference
between what is real and what is not real. We may wonder whether the
Buddha's teaching is not a philosophical system which deals with
abstractions. On the contrary, the Buddha's teaching helps us to know
ourselves, to know our different moments of wholesomeness and
unwholesomeness. He taught the way to eradicate attachment, aversion and
ignorance.
