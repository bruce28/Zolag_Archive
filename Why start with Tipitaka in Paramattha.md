## In Survey of Paramattha Dhammas you commence with a detailed analysis of the Tipitaka. What books it comprises of etc. Why did you or Khun Sujin choose to start with this?


N: To show it is not her own ideas but the Buddhaâ€™s teaching contained in Tipitaka and commentaries. The Buddha passed away but the Dhamma contained in the scriptures is his successor. They all point to realities appearing at the present moment. If we do not forget this we can read the texts with right understanding. Intellectual understanding can be a condition for the arising of direct understanding, satipatthana, later on. But we should not cling to the idea of having direct understanding. It all depends on the right conditions.
We read time and again about seeing, visible object, thinking, and these are realities that can be understood as elements, devoid of self, conditiond, having no owner. The Buddha asked: are they permanent or impermanent? They are gone immediately, so, where is the self who could be master of them?
