This book is a follow-up of my book “The Buddha’s Path”, where I have explained the basic principles of the Buddha’s teachings. In this book I would like to introduce the reader to the Buddhist scriptures which contain the teaching of the Buddha. I will quote more extensively from the texts with the aim to encourage the reader to study the texts himself. In that way he can verify himself that the Buddha’s words were directed to the practice of what he taught, in particular to the development of right understanding of all phenomena of our life. 
In the Appendix I have enumerated the texts of the Tipiìaka and their commentaries with their translations into English.
For the now following chapters I have used many ideas of the lectures for a radio program in Thailand by Sujin Boriharnwanaket. She quotes extensively from all three parts of the scriptures, explains their meaning and inspires people to relate them to their daily life. If we merely read the texts with the purpose of intellectual understanding, we fail to see the message they contain for our life at this moment and we do not understand the goal of the Buddha’s teachings.
