## Dear Alan,

I made some corrections in my Cetasikas, in the Chapter on Chanda, Ch 13. This is called Zeal, but now I call it: Interest (Chanda).
Acharn suggested to use the translation of interest instead of desire-to-do.
In the quote from the Visuddhimagga I could not make a change, but elsewhere I either use chanda (as I did already) or interest. I took the whole chapter which I send you as an attachment.
