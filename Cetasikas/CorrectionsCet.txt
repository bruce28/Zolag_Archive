Dear Alan,

A slight amendment in Cetasikas, Ch 21, p. 196, last para in the book but in the doc it is Ch 22, p 154
(I render it in Velthuis):

 The canker of desire for becoming or rebirth, bhavaasava, is another one of the aasavas. Even the anaagaamii who has eradicated all clinging to sensuous objects, can still have clinging to becoming or rebirth. So long as there is attachment to any kind of rebirth one has to continue to be in the cycle of birth and death.
---------------

And p. 200 in book, § 2: (in doc. p. 157 above):
 Every time we like one of the sense objects we are in the flood of sensuous
desire, we fail to see the danger of this flood, we are forgetful.
-------
Thus, change sensuous objects into sense objects. Further, all over the book I have some corrections, but I do not know whether you have taken these in your document, or should I mention them again? I cannot remember.
