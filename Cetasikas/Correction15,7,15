Dear Alan,
A correction in Survey, appendix cetasikas, in the book p. 420, footnote 6: 

old version: [6] Thus, it is different from akusala kamma and kusala kamma that bring their results later on. One usually thinks of kamma as a good or bad deed, but the reality of kamma is actually cetanā cetasika. Cetanā is not only akusala or kusala, but it is also vipāka and kiriya. Cetanā that is vipāka or kiriya merely coordinates the tasks of the citta and cetasikas it accompanies, and thus it is conascent kamma-condition. Cetanā that is akusala or kusala has a double task: it coordinates the tasks of the accompanying nāma dhammas and it “wills” or intends akusala or kusala.

new version: Thus, it is different from akusala kamma and kusala kamma that bring their results later on. One usually thinks of kamma as a good or bad deed, but the reality of kamma is actually cetanā cetasika. Cetanā is not only akusala or kusala, but it is also vipāka and kiriya. Cetanā of all four jātis  coordinates the tasks of the citta and cetasikas it accompanies and is thereby conascent kamma-condition. Cetanā that is akusala or kusala of the degree of kamma patha (completed course of action) and, after it has fallen away, produces vipāka, is kamma-condition operating from a different time.
