    A: I know we have discussed this before but I would like Ajahn's view on this issue in schools (and anyone on this forum )if possible.

    Below is a quote from a report to the Government about the benefits of secular mindfulness (without the Buddhist teachings). in schools 

    "Methods for training mindfulness have long been central to the contemplative traditions of Asia, especially Buddhism. Using these methods, but freeing them from any religious or dogmatic content, Jon Kabat-Zinn began teaching his Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course (MBSR)" (‘Mindful Nation UK Report’, 2015)

    The below are quotes from the Teaching Standards which are required by law for all UK schools.

    "establish a safe and stimulating environment for pupils, rooted in mutual respect."
    "having regard for the need to safeguard pupils’ well-being, in accordance with statutory provisions."

    My question. Does this Mindfulness without the Buddhist Teachings compromise or possibly compromise the Health and Safety of children?

S: Ajahn's comments for the most part;

- It "hurts" the Teachings, but only if referred to as the Buddha's Teachings.

- Does it give any tranquillity or is it just for pleasant feeling?

- No understanding of reality.

- Just conventional ideas which are not true, so wrong ideas leading to wrong speech, thinking it's right.

- If they persist with wrong practices and wrong concentration, they can go crazy.

- Is one disturbed now when thinking about these things? Is there any understanding now?
