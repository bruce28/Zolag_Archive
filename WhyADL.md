'We need the terms, because the English translations of the terms are different and not always correct.'

Many translate sammasankappa wrongly as right intention, thereby adding to great confusion as to the development of the eightfold Path. As if there is any intention to develop it. Cetanaa is usually translated as intention or volition.
Vitakka touches the object so that citta can experience it. Sammasankappa touches the nama or rupa that appears, so that panna can know it as it is.

N: Yes. Going to Abhidhamma texts, like the Vibhanga, Book of Analysis. Ch 11, Analysis of the Path Constituents, p. 310: Therein what is right thought? That which is mentation, thinking, thought, fixation, focussing, application of the mind, right thought, path constituent, included in the path. This is called right thought. Nothing to do with intention. Now, whatever text we read, we should not forget that it all pertains to daily life now. as Acharn often says. This is the best way to get the correct meaning of a word. As soon as there is any idea of intending to be aware of a reality, we completely forget about anatta, beyond control. Awareness is just a dhamma, a conditioned reality. Just as in the case of seeing, who can make it arise?

Precision: Love

Depth of understanding. Helps to correct wrong practice.

ADL helps to understand the original AD.

Helps understand anatta.

Concept and reality, refers to daily life

It is difficult be content to learn it a small bit at a time. The Buddha's path is an easier starting point.
We should not cling to terms but the words are to help understand reality.

Abhidhamma in Daily Life is an exposition of absolute realities in detail. Abhidhamma means higher doctrine and the book's purpose is to encourage the right application of Buddhism in order to eradicate wrong view and eventually all defilements. Many terms in Pali the language of early Buddhism are used and are defined as they are introduced. The book is therefore suitable for beginners as well as practicing Buddhists. It is detailed and precise and an invaluable aid to unlocking the deep meaning of the entire Buddhist canon and applying the theory to our daily lives for the benefit of ourselves and others.
