'We need the terms, because the English translations of the terms are different and not always correct.'

Many translate sammasankappa wrongly as right intention, thereby adding to great confusion as to the development of the eightfold Path. As if there is any intention to develop it. Cetanaa is usually translated as intention or volition.
Vitakka touches the object so that citta can experience it. Sammasankappa touches the nama or rupa that appears, so that panna can know it as it is.

N: Yes. Going to Abhidhamma texts, like the Vibhanga, Book of Analysis. Ch 11, Analysis of the Path Constituents, p. 310: Therein what is right thought? That which is mentation, thinking, thought, fixation, focussing, application of the mind, right thought, path constituent, included in the path. This is called right thought. Nothing to do with intention. Now, whatever text we read, we should not forget that it all pertains to daily life now. as Acharn often says. This is the best way to get the correct meaning of a word. As soon as there is any idea of intending to be aware of a reality, we completely forget about anatta, beyond control. Awareness is just a dhamma, a conditioned reality. Just as in the case of seeing, who can make it arise?
