You want texts? I have to think over this.
Soon my latest writing Sharing Dhamma will be sent to you.

Dear Nina,
Thanks for this. When you write your books are you working with the Pali translations or the actual Pali texts or both?
Is there any way we can show the translation to be wrong?
Best wishes,
Alan

Both, but my Pali is limited. But we need the terms, because the English translations of the terms are different and not always correct.

N: Yes. Going to Abhidhamma texts, like the Vibhanga, Book of Analysis. Ch 11, Analysis of the Path Constituents, p. 310: <Therein what is right thought? That which is mentation, thinking, thought, fixation, focussing, application of the mind, right thought, path constituent, included in the path. This is called right thought.>
Nothing to do with intention.
Now, whatever text we read, we should not forget that it all pertains to daily life now. <It is not in the book> as Acharn often says. This is the best way to get the correct meaning of a word.
As soon as there is any idea of intending to be aware of a reality, we completely forget about anatta, beyond control. Awareness is just a dhamma, a conditioned reality. Just as in the case of seeing, who can make it arise?
