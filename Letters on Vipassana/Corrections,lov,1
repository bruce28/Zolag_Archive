DONE

Dear Alan & Nina

Congratulations on the new book. I know Vincent and the Vietnamese were planning to translate it (if they haven't already). I'd also like to receive a hard-back copy - perhaps I can order one from Amazon?

Nina & Alan, at the beginning of the first letter, we'd like to request a small change for accuracy. Alan always says that as the books are printed 'on demand' it's easy to make a change. So just if it is easy -

You wrote: 
Sarah and Jonothan traveled from Hong Kong to Bangkok in
order to visit Acharn Sujin and talk about problems concerning
the development of satipatthāana

Please can you change to:
Sarah and Jonothan were having/had discussions with Khun Sujin in Bangkok about the Buddha’s Teachings

or Sarah & Jonothan had conversations with Khun Suin about the development of right understanding. 

I've never thought about/mentioned "problems concerning the development of satipatthāna" so would prefer the change.

Best wishes

Sarah
