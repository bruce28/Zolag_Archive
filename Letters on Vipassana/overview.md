Letters about Vipassåna 



Preface 



This book consists of a compilation of letters on the Dhamma to Sarah Abbott, 

Alan Weller, Robert Kirkpatrick and other friends. These letters were written in 

the period between 1980 until 1992. The material I have used are tapes of Khun 

Sujin’s lectures and conversations with her on the development of right 

understanding. She encourages people to develop understanding of the present 

moment, since that is the way to the ultimate goal, namely, the eradication of 

the clinging to the concept of self and of all other defilements. What the Buddha 

taught is not mere theory, but it is to be applied right now, at this moment. The 

Buddha taught that all mental phenomena and physical phenomena which 

naturally appear in our daily life can be objects of mindfulness and right 

understanding. 



I greatly appreciate Khun Sujin’s constant reminders to develop right 

understanding naturally, and not to force oneself to particular practices. Before 

one realizes it one is lured by clinging to the idea of self. The scriptures are 

subtle, profound in meaning, and when one is reading them one may be deluded 

by wrong understanding. Khun Sujin’s clear explanations of the Dhamma are of 

immense value and can have a great impact on one’s life. I hope that the reader 

will find these letters on vipassanå beneficial.
