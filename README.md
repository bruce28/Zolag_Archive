### Buddha Code


All of the files on this site are text files (utf-8 font needed) in various markup languages. Some have published in print form under the imprint of Zolag.
The extension indicates the markup language e.g:

```

- for texinfo, texinfo
- for markdown, md
- for latex, tex

```

All of these texts are open, the type of licence is in the Book_info file. You  are free to copy them,  to quote portions of the text, make ebooks and printed books and articles. 

You can obtain most of these documents in pretty PDF or word docs from
[archive.org](http://archive.org/bookmarks/Alan%20Weller)

My aim with the site is to make this content available on all internet devices (especially my new Firefox Os phone!) as well as in print. This site enables collaboration on texts, several people are able to edit a single article.
 I wish to have all these articles and books in markdown and then convert them to multitude of formats using Pandoc.

### Priorities

- convert all doc texts to unedited markdown
- compile a glossary for The Buddha's Path


Enjoy,

Alan Weller
