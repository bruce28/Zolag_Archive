Description

We have accumulated many kinds of defilements during countless lives and, thus, there are conditions for the arising of unwholesomeness, akusala, time and again. Because of our defilements we do not have enough strength to walk the Path the Buddha taught and therefore we need to accumulate all kinds of wholesome qualities which can support us while we develop right understanding of realities. We are not destined to become a Sammsambuddha, but if we develop the perfections along with satipatthana there are conditions to attain enlightenment, one day, during one life, we do not know when. When we develop the perfections we should not expect any gain for ourselves, our goal should be the eradication of defilements. If this is not our goal dana, si�la and the other wholesome qualities are not perfections leading to enlightenment.

Description

This pilgrimage in India, in 1975, was my third one in a long series that would follow. Acharn Sujin Boriharnwanaket, our friend in the Dhamma and our teacher, was our spiritual leader and Khun Suwat Chansuvityanant was in charge of the organisation of the tour. The late venerable Bhikkhu Dhamma-dharo from Australia who had recently been ordained, venerable Jetanando, a novice (samanera) from Japan, Jonothan Abbot, and a few friends from Thailand also joined this tour. Khun Suwat who would also organise all the following pilgrimages in India, always found a suitable picknick spot in the fields when the bus drivers had to take a break. There were often flat tyres or other defects of the bus and then we could walk along in the village and have some tea. Since our group was small we could stay in Thai temples on the way. Acharn Sujin helped us all the way with reminders of the Dhamma, for example, when the bus had to stop and we were walking up and down, waiting. In each of the holy places texts were read that related to that particular place. Venerable Bhikkhu Dhammadharo explained the Dhamma with great enthusiasm, emphasizing that, in whatever situation we would be, there were just mental phenomena, nåma and physical phenomena, rúpa, appearing through the six doorways. We discussed the Buddha�s perfections as we did during each pilgrimage. These were the indispensable conditions for his attainment of Buddhahood. We were reminded that also for us the development of the perfections along with satipaììhåna is a necessary condition for the attainment of enlightenment.

The Conditionality of Life (2010)

Status: in print

Author: Nina van Gorkom
Keywords: abhidhamma; buddhism; theravada; theravada buddhism; tipitaka; condition
Publisher: Zolag
Year: 2010
Collection: opensource
Description

Why do we do what we do? why do we see what we see? Seeing, attachment, generosity, all experiences in life can arise only because of a concurrence of conditions. This book is an introduction to the seventh book of the Abhidhamma, that deals with the conditionality of life. It explains the deep underlying motives for all actions through body, speech and mind and shows that these are dependent on conditions and cannot be controlled by a �self�. The study of conditions is indispensable for understanding the teaching of the �Dependent Origination�, the factors that condition our being in the cycle of birth and death. It will help the reader to understand the meaning of the Buddha�s teaching of non-self, which can lead to the eradication of wrong view and liberation from the cycle of birth and death. This book that deals with the intricacy of conditions is suitable for those who have already made a study of the Buddha�s teachings.

Cetasika means belonging to the mind. It is a mental factor which accompanies consciousness (citta) and experiences an object. There are 52 cetasikas.

It will help the student have more understanding of the intricate operations of the mind enabling the development of good qualities and the eventual eradication of all defilements. It will help to understand that citta and cetasika act according to their own conditions and that an abiding agent (soul or self) is not to be found. The book assumes some previous knowledge of Buddhism.
