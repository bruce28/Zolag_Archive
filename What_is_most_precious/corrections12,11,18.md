a correction, end of ch 1: footnote 1:

When his dying-consciousness falls away, at his parinibbåna, he has reached the end of dukkha, the arising and falling away of realities.

And in the dialogue with Jonothan: Jonothan: “We come to understand this intellectually at first. The cessation of dukkha takes place only at his parinibbāna, the end of saṃsāra.” 

Erase: arahatship. 

BTW I notice that in Word, the pali accents do not come over well. What to do? 


Sarah suggested more of the original text, not shortened as I did.
---------------------------------

Uncorrected  text: Jonothan: “All realities are dukkha, there is no future.”

Nina: ”Because they fall away. There is so much thinking about it.”

Jonothan: “We come to understand this intellectually at first. The cessation of dukkha takes place only at arahatship, parinibbāna, the end of saṃsāra.”[1] 

Nina: ”There is hearing, thinking, but not understanding. It is so much theory for me.”

Jonothan: “It is theory for all of us, when understanding is of the intellectual level. You asked about the connection with seeing the danger of saṃsāra.”


Correction: J:  So if all  realities are dukkha, there is no future in realities, no reason to want to keep experiencing realities, to want to be in the world of realities either because it's dukkha.
 
N:  But there is so much thinking!
 
J: But that's part of the truths that we come to understand intellectually at first and the cessation of dukkha takes place only at parinibbāna, not before. For the arahat the realities are still dukkha, so parinibbāna and the escape from saṃsāra at the end of saṃsāra are the same thing.
 
N:  It's so much thinking and really not understanding. It's so much theory for me.
Jonothan: J:  Well, It's theory for all of us but at an intellectual level, because you asked about the connection between... 
 
N: seeing the danger of saṃsāra...yes, I find it a difficult point...
 
Ajahn:  That's why, no matter (what) we are talking about,  what it should end with - seeing the danger of whatever appears and life otherwise one is so pleased with studying, with understanding.
 
N: I find it really difficult to get this point.
 
Ajahn:  Becuse it's not trying to have it but by understanding from undersstanding on and on and on, we can see the point of study, what for? Just to see the danger of life.
(Then as is:  Acharn explained that that the actual moment of seeing the danger of life must be vipassanā ñāna [1].

[1]                This is paññā of the level of direct understanding of realities.
*****

[1]                The arahat has eradicated all defilements and, therefore, he does not have to be reborn. When his dying-consciousness has fallen away, at his parinibbåna, he has reached the end of dukkha, the arising and falling away of realities.
