## Causation sutta
from Sharing Stories

The Sammāsambuddha had realized all by himself, through his enlighten-
ment, the truth of all dhammas.
We read in the “Gradual Sayings,” Book of the Threes, Ch XIV, §134, Appear-
ance, that the Buddha said:
“Monks, whether there be an appearance or non-appearance of a
Tathāgata, this causal law of nature, this orderly fixing of
dhammas prevails, namely, all phenomena are impermanent.
About this a Tathāgata is fully enlightened, he fully understands
it. So enlightened and understanding he declares, teaches and
makes it plain. He shows it, he opens it up, explains and makes
it clear: this fact that all phenomena are impermanent.”

The Buddha’s teachings are subtle and deep
and therefore it is necessary to go into details. preface BP

One should know
that it takes time and patience to understand what this Path is
and how one can begin to develop it.BP preface

In this book I have used a few P ̄
 ali terms which can be of
use to those who intend to deepen their knowledge of Buddhism.
The English equivalents of the P ̄
 ali terms are frequently unsat-
isfactory since they stem from Western philosophy and therefore
give an association of meaning which is different from the mean-
ing intended by the Buddhist teachings.

The Pali term dukkha is to be preferred, since the word “suffering” does
not cover completely the meaning of the first noble Truth.
