## Causation sutta
from Sharing Stories

The Sammāsambuddha had realized all by himself, through his enlighten-
ment, the truth of all dhammas.
We read in the “Gradual Sayings,” Book of the Threes, Ch XIV, §134, Appear-
ance, that the Buddha said:
“Monks, whether there be an appearance or non-appearance of a
Tathāgata, this causal law of nature, this orderly fixing of
dhammas prevails, namely, all phenomena are impermanent.
About this a Tathāgata is fully enlightened, he fully understands
it. So enlightened and understanding he declares, teaches and
makes it plain. He shows it, he opens it up, explains and makes
it clear: this fact that all phenomena are impermanent.”

The Buddha’s teachings are subtle and deep
and therefore it is necessary to go into details. preface BP

One should know
that it takes time and patience to understand what this Path is
and how one can begin to develop it.BP preface

In this book I have used a few P ̄
 ali terms which can be of
use to those who intend to deepen their knowledge of Buddhism.
The English equivalents of the P ̄
 ali terms are frequently unsat-
isfactory since they stem from Western philosophy and therefore
give an association of meaning which is different from the mean-
ing intended by the Buddhist teachings.

The Pali term dukkha is to be preferred, since the word “suffering” does
not cover completely the meaning of the first noble Truth.

The deep meaning
of the suttas cannot be understood without a basic study of the
Abhidhamma. The field of the Abhidhamma is immense and we
cannot grasp the whole contents. However, when one begins to
study it, at least in part, one will see that it can be of great
assistance for the understanding of our life. Some people have
doubt as to the authenticity of the Abhidhamma, they doubt
whether it is the teaching of the Buddha himself. As one studies
the Abhidhamma one will see for oneself that the Abhidhamma
teaches about phenomena which can be experienced at this mo-
ment. The Abhidhamma deals with seeing, visible object, with
all experiences through the senses and the mind, with all whole-
some qualities, with all defilements. The different parts of the
scriptures are one, they are the Buddha’s teachings.
