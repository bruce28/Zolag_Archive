## Causation sutta
from Sharing Stories

The Sammāsambuddha had realized all by himself, through his enlighten-
ment, the truth of all dhammas.
We read in the “Gradual Sayings,” Book of the Threes, Ch XIV, §134, Appear-
ance, that the Buddha said:
“Monks, whether there be an appearance or non-appearance of a
Tathāgata, this causal law of nature, this orderly fixing of
dhammas prevails, namely, all phenomena are impermanent.
About this a Tathāgata is fully enlightened, he fully understands
it. So enlightened and understanding he declares, teaches and
makes it plain. He shows it, he opens it up, explains and makes
it clear: this fact that all phenomena are impermanent.”

The Buddha’s teachings are subtle and deep
and therefore it is necessary to go into details. BP
